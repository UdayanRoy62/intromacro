# Preface {-}

These are my lecture notes for a course called *Introduction to Macroeconomics* that I have taught for three decades. 

The required textbook for my course is *Brief Principles of Macroeconomics* by N. Gregory Mankiw. Although Mankiw's book is excellent, in my teaching I have constantly felt the need to make small adjustments. Until now, I have been making these adjustments in the PowerPoint slides I use in the classroom. But the availability of new technology -- especially *R*, *R Studio*, the *bookdown* package in *R*, and *Github* -- has made it easy for me to gather my slides and turn them into a free online form that actually reads like a textbook.
