# Preface {-}

These are my lecture notes for a course called *Introduction to Macroeconomics* that I have taught for three decades. 

The required textbook for my course is *Brief Principles of Macroeconomics* by N. Gregory Mankiw. Although that is an excellent book, in my teaching I have constantly felt the need to make small adjustments of my own. Until now, I have been making these adjustments in my PowerPoint slides. But the availability of new technology -- especially *R*, *R Studio*, the *bookdown* package in *R*, and *Github* -- has made it easy for me to gather my slides and turn them into a free online textbook.

Moreover, reading slides usually makes for a choppy experience. A fleshed out set of lecture notes may be more helpful to students.
