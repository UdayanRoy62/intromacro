Macroeconomics is the study of the economy as a whole. Its goal is to explain the economic changes that affect many households, firms, and markets at once. Macroeconomics answers questions such as these: Why is average income high in some countries and low in others? Why do prices rise rapidly in some time periods while they are more stable in others? Why do production and employment expand in some years and contract in others? 4.1.2 The Role of Data To see whether an economy faces a problem, you first need data. Data help policy makers see what problems, if any, need to be addressed Data help macroeconomists identify the theories that make correct predictions and the theories that make incorrect predictions Data often reveal interesting puzzles that macroeconomic theories need to solve 4.2 Gross Domestic Product 4.2.1 Total Income Recall that we need to measure the health of an economy. When judging whether an economy is doing well or poorly, it is natural to look at the total income that the people in the economy are earning. We can temporarily boost our standard of living by borrowing from others. But we cant keep borrowing forever. This is why a nations standard of living depends heavily on its own total income. 4.2.2 Income = Expenditure We could measure either total income or total expenditure. We would get the same number either way. For an economy as a whole, income must equal expenditure because: Every transaction has a buyer and a seller. Every dollar of spending by some buyer is a dollar of income for some seller. But what about saving? Q: People typically save part of what they earn. How then is income equal to expenditure for the economy as a whole? A: What people save tends to get loaned to businesses who then spend the money they borrowed. So, for the economy as a whole, income must still equal expenditure. But what about international trade? We buy foreign-made goods and foreigners buy goods made by us. Q: In that case, how can our total income be equal to our total expenditure? A: This is correct. It is better to say that total income of domestic residents equals the total expenditure on domestically produced goods. 4.2.3 Gross Domestic Product: Definition Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is one measure of a countrys total income. There are other measures of total income, but GDP is the most popular measure. GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time. For example, the GDP of the United States in 2017 was $19,390.6 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. Given a mid-year population of 325,983,000 (est.) the per capita (or, per human) GDP was $59,484. GDP is also the total expenditure on all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time. GDP is also the total income of all domestically located resources. 4.2.3.1 GDP is the Market Value  In GDP, all output is valued at market prices. The market value of all sandwiches produced is both the total expenditure of the buyers of those sandwiches and the total income of the makers of those sandwiches. As our goal is to measure total income, it therefore makes sense to measure the market values of the various produced goods and add them up. 4.2.3.2  Of All Final Goods  Final goods are those goods sold to their final users. Heres an example of a final good: A pencil is a final good because, once produced, it is ready for use by its final users. The wood, the graphite, and other materials that disappeared in the pencil are not final goods. Their market value is already counted when the market value of the pencil is counted. So, counting them in GDP would count them twice. GDP records only the value of final goods, not intermediate goods. Intermediate goods are those goods that disappear inside other goods that are produced for sale. Final goods are goods that are not intermediate goods. These are goods sold to their final users. GDP is defined so that the value of intermediate goods is counted only once, not twice or thrice. Intermediate goods are goods that are sold by their producers to producers of other goods. Examples: milk sold by a dairy to an ice-cream company, grapes sold by a vineyard to a winemaker, printer paper sold to Kinkos. Final goods are goods that are sold to the final users of those goods. Examples: milk you buy at the supermarket, table grapes you buy at the farmers market, printer paper you buy for your computer printer. All goods made this year but not sold by years end are regarded as final goods (inventories). Suppose a dairy farmer sells milk worth $50,000 to an ice-cream company. The farmer does not buy anything from any other firm. The total income of the dairy farmer and her employees is, therefore, $50,000. The ice-cream company uses the milk to produce ice-cream which it sells for $75,000. The ice-cream company does not buy anything from any firm other than the dairy. Therefore, the total income of the owners and employees of the ice-cream firm is $25,000. Therefore, the total income of this country is $75,000. This is accurately measured by the value of the ice-cream (the final good) alone. Had we also counted milk, the intermediate good, we would have calculated total income to be $125,000, which would have been an exaggeration. 4.2.3.3  and Services  GDP includes both tangible goods (food, clothing, cars) and intangible services (haircuts, housecleaning, doctor visits, legal consultations). Trade in assets does not affect GDP. Such trade does not require new productive activity, it is merely the transfer of ownership of an asset from one person to another. Neither participant is paying the other for a good or service. They are simply exchanging property. 4.2.3.4  Produced Within a Country  GDP measures the value of all production within the geographic boundaries of a country. The citizenship of the owners of the resources used in production is not the key issue. Production by foreigners living in a country is counted in that countrys GDP. Production by a countrys citizens working in other countries is not counted. 4.2.3.5  In a given period of time GDP measures the value of production that takes place within a specific interval of time, usually a year or a quarter (three months). GDP measures the value of goods and services currently produced. GDP ignores current transactions that involve goods that were produced in the past. Current transactions involving used cars or buildings that were constructed in the past are not counted in current GDP. 4.2.4 Whats not counted in GDP? GDP includes the market value of all items produced in the economy and sold legally in markets. It excludes items produced and sold illicitly, such as illegal drugs. GDP excludes most items that are produced and consumed at home and that never enter the marketplace. For more on Gross Domestic Product, check out this video. 4.3 Nominal and Real GDP How can we measure a nations productive activity in different years so that the numbers can be compared across time? The GDP we have seen so far is more precisely called Nominal GDP. One cant use data on nominal GDP for 1915 and 2015 to draw a meaningful conclusion about productive activity in those two years. GDP comes in two flavors: Nominal GDP (also called GDP at current prices), and Real GDP (also called GDP at constant prices) So, when you see or hear a discussion of GDP, be sure to ask, Nominal or real? 4.3.1 Gross Domestic Product, Nominal Nominal GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time. The market value is calculated using current prices, the prices that prevailed when the production took place. For example, the nominal GDP of the United States in 2017 was $19,390.6 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. Given a mid-year population of 325,983,000 (est.) the per capita (or, per human) nominal GDP was $59,484. 4.3.2 Gross Domestic Product, Real Real GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time. This is the same as for nominal GDP, but theres a twist. The market value is now calculated using constant prices, the prices that prevailed in a benchmark year called the base year. For example, the real GDP of the United States in 2017 was $17,096.2 billion in 2009 dollars, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. Given a mid-year population of 325,983,000 (est.) the per capita (or, per human) real GDP was $52,445 in 2009 dollars. To further explore the difference between the calculation of Nominal GDP and Real GDP, take a look at Figure 4.1. It presents a numerical example showing the calculation of nominal and real GDP, this time with hypothetical data: Figure 4.1: Calculation of Nominal and Real GDP with hypothetical data For more on Nominal vs. Real GDP, see this video. And heres a chart showing Nominal and Real GDP for the US: Figure 4.2: Real GDP in 2012 Dollars and Nominal GDP The data source for Figure 4.2 is here. 4.3.3 The GDP Deflator The GDP deflator is a measure of the overall level of the prices of the final goods and services produced within a country during a given period of time. The GDP Deflator tells us how much of the rise in nominal GDP over a period of time is attributable to a rise in prices (rather than to a rise in production). The GDP Deflator is calculated as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} \\textrm{GDP Deflator for 2018 with Base Year 2009}\\equiv\\frac{\\textrm{Nominal GDP in 2018}}{\\textrm{ Real GDP in 2018 with Base Year 2009}}\\times 100 \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] Example: In 2013, US Nominal GDP was $16,803.0 billion. US Real GDP was $15,767.1 billion (in chained 2009 dollars). Therefore, US GDP Deflator = (16,803.0/15,767.1) × 100 = 106.57. This means that the final goods and services produced in 2013 had a market value in 2013 prices that was 106.57 percent of their market value in 2009 prices. This means that, roughly, final goods and services were on average 6.57% pricier in 2013 than in 2009. Figure 4.3 presents another numerical example showing the calculation of nominal and real GDP, again with hypothetical data, and emphasizing the calculation of the GDP Deflator: Figure 4.3: Calculation of Nominal GDP, Real GDP, and the GDP Deflator with hypothetical data By the way, why do we call the GDP Deflator a deflator? Nominal GDP changes from one year to the next partly because of inflation. Real GDP, on the other hand, changes because of changes in production alone. The GDP Deflator can convert Nominal GDP to Real GDP by deflating the effect of inflation in Nominal GDP. Hence, the name deflator. 4.3.3.1 Converting Nominal GDP to Real GDP using the GDP Deflator Note that Equation (4.1) above can easily be re-written as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} \\textrm{Real GDP in 2018 with Base Year 2009}\\equiv\\frac{\\textrm{Nominal GDP in 2018}}{\\textrm{GDP Deflator for 2018 with Base Year 2009}}\\times 100 \\tag{4.2} \\end{equation}\\] Therefore, if you know the numbers for Nominal GDP and the GDP Deflator, you can calculate Real GDP. 4.3.4 The Growth Rate of GDP Consider the value of a variable at two dates. The growth rate of the variable over the intervening period is the increase in the value of the variable from the earlier date to the later date divided by the value of the variable at the earlier date. Multiply by 100 to express the growth rate as a percentage, if you wish. In the case of the annual growth rate of GDP, see Equation (4.3): \\[\\begin{equation} \\textrm{GDP Growth Rate in 2018}\\equiv\\frac{\\textrm{GDP in 2018} - \\textrm{GDP in 2017}}{\\textrm{GDP in 2017}}\\times100 \\tag{4.3} \\end{equation}\\] Note that the growth rate could be negative, if GDP decreases over time. Figure 4.4 continues with the hypothetical data in Figure 4.1 and calculates the growth rate of GDP: Figure 4.4: Calculation of Nominal GDP, Real GDP, and their growth rates with hypothetical data Returning to actual data, heres a chart showing the growth rates of real GDP for the United States: Figure 4.5: Annual Growth Rate of Real GDP in 2012 Dollars The data source for Figure 4.5 is here. 4.4 GDP and the Components of GDP We need to pay attention not only to the total expenditure on all final goods and services made in a country (that is, to GDP, nominal or real), we also need to watch where the expenditure is coming from. That way, when theres a recession, well know which sector needs the most attention. Expenditure on Made in USA final goods and services can come from only these four sources: Households (Consumption expenditure) Businesses (Investment expenditure) Government entities (Government purchases) Foreigners (Exports) So, one might think that: \\[\\textrm{GDP} = \\textrm{Consumption Spending} + \\textrm{Investment Spending} + \\textrm{Government Spending} + \\textrm{Exports}.\\] But that would be incorrect! The correct equation linking total expenditure (or, GDP) to its component expenditures is instead the following: \\[\\textrm{GDP} = \\textrm{Consumption Spending} + \\textrm{Investment Spending} + \\textrm{Government Spending} + \\textrm{Exports}-\\textrm{Imports}.\\] Q: Why do we subtract imports? A: GDP is the market value of all final Made in USA goods. But consumption, investment, and government purchases all include spending on foreign goods. Therefore, to make the two sides of the equation the same, we must take out all the imports. Exports  Imports is called Net Exports. 4.4.1 The Four Components Of GDP Consumption (\\(C\\)): The spending by households on goods and services, with the exception of purchases of new housing. Investment (\\(I\\)): The spending on capital equipment, inventories, and structures, including new housing. Government Purchases (\\(G\\)): The spending on goods and services by local, state, and federal governments. Does not include transfer payments because they are not made in exchange for currently produced goods or services. Net Exports (\\(NX\\)): Exports minus imports. Throughout this book, real GDP will be denoted by the symbol \\(Y\\). Then, the last equation above becomes: \\[\\begin{equation} Y=C+I+G+NX. \\tag{4.4} \\end{equation}\\] This equation, which will be used again and again throughout this book is called the national income identity.1 For more on the link between GDP and its components, see this video. 4.4.2 US data on GDP and its Components Two excellent sources of data on GDP and its components for the US are: Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Check out these links: Consumption, as a share of GDP Investment, as a share of GDP Government Purchases, as a share of GDP Net Exports, as a share of GDP Exports Imports 4.5 International GDP comparisons How can we measure national productive activity so that the numbers can be meaningfully compared across nations? When the GDP numbers for various countries are compared, the same currency units must be used. There are two ways of converting from national currencies to a common currency, such as the US dollar: Use market exchange rates Use a common set of prices (Purchasing Power Parity) 4.5.1 Market Exchange Rate Method Step 1: Look up Mexicos GDP in Mexicos currency, the peso. Step 2: Look up how many US dollars one Mexican peso is worth. Step 3: Multiply the numbers in Steps 1 and 2. This gives you Mexicos GDP in US dollars. When the GDPs of two countries are both expressed in US dollars, they can be compared head to head. 4.5.2 Purchasing Power Parity Method Step 1: Find out the quantities of all the final goods that were produced in Mexico during, say, 2016 Step 2: Find out the prices of those goods in the United Statesnot Mexicoin 2016. These prices are in US dollars. Step 3: Calculate Mexicos GDP in US dollars, by Step 3a: multiplying the quantities in Step 1 by the corresponding prices in Step 2 and Step 3b: then adding the results obtained in Step 3a 4.5.3 Lets Compare the Two Methods GDP per capita (current US$) GDP per capita, PPP (current international $) GDP per capita (constant 2010 US $) GDP per capita, PPP (constant 2011 international $) Lets Compare GDP! Lets Compare GDP per capita! For more on the basic facts of economic prosperity across countris, see this video 4.6 Is GDP a good measure of economic well-being? No, but it is the best one-number measure we have. Theres a lot about well-being thats missing in GDP: economic inequality, work done in home, volunteer work, illegal work, leisure, environment, disasters,  4.6.1 Income Inequality Trends in US Poverty Rate 4.6.2 Leisure Reduces GDP 4.6.3 GDP Doesnt Count Illegal Work 4.6.4 GDP Doesnt Count Work at Home 4.6.5 GDP Doesnt Count Volunteer Work 4.6.6 GDP Ignores Environmental Damage 4.6.7 GDP Ignores Consumer Surplus Free digital technology, Free Apps, Google, Google maps, Wikipedia, OpenOffice, YouTube, Freely available education (Khan Academy, Coursera)  None of this adds to GDP. Users would be willing to pay but dont. They get Consumer Surplus. 4.6.8 Disasters May Raise GDP 4.6.9 Theres a lot more to life than production Heres Robert F. Kennedy reminding us of all that is missing in GDP: (Gross Domestic Product) does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education, or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our courage, nor our wisdom, nor our devotion to our country. It measures everything, in short, except that which makes life worthwhile, and it can tell us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans. 4.6.10 So, in the final analysis  GDP is the best single measure of the economic well-being of a society. GDP per person tells us the income and expenditure of the average person in the economy. For more on the link between Real GDP Per Capita and the Standard of Living, see this video. An identity is an equation that is always true, simply by virtue of the way the variables in the equation are defined. "],["costofliving.html", "Chapter 5 Measuring the Cost of Living 5.1 The Consumer Price Index 5.2 How the CPI Is Calculated 5.3 Correcting Economic Variables For The Effects Of Inflation", " Chapter 5 Measuring the Cost of Living Whats the cost of living the way we actually live? That is, whats the cost of buying the things we buy? Why do we need to know the cost of living? 5.1 The Consumer Price Index The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the overall cost of the goods and services bought by a typical consumer. So, it is a measure of the cost of living. Heres CPI data for the United States: https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.toc.htm. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports the CPI eevery month. Heres another source for the same data: http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/CPIAUCSL. Changes in the CPI are used to monitor changes in the cost of living over time. When the CPI rises, the typical family has to spend more dollars to maintain the same standard of living. 5.2 How the CPI Is Calculated Fix the Typical Consumers Basket (TCB): figure out whats in the basket of goods and services that the typical consumer buys. Find the prices paid by the typical consumer for the goods in the TCB. Compute the TCBs market value in all years. Choose a Base Year and compute the CPI for all years, using Equation (5.1) below. Compute the inflation rates for all years, using Equation (5.2) below. 5.2.1 How the CPI Is Calculated: Fix the Typical Consumers Basket (TCB) We need to determine what basket of goods and services that the typical consumer buys. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) conducts a survey and determines the TCB. 5.2.2 How the CPI Is Calculated: Find the Prices The BLS conducts monthly consumer surveys to also determine the prices of the goods and services in the TCB. We need to find the prices of each of the goods and services in the typical consumers basket for each year. 5.2.3 How the CPI Is Calculated: Compute the Baskets Market Value Use the data on prices to calculate the market value of the typical consumers basket for each year. 5.2.4 How the CPI Is Calculated: Choose a Base Year and Compute the CPI Designate a particular year as the base year, making it the benchmark year against which other years are compared. Compute the CPI for any given year as follows: Divide the market value of the typical consumers basket in the given year by its market value in the base year. Then, multiply the result by 100. \\[\\begin{equation} \\textrm{CPI for 2018 with Base Year 2009}\\equiv\\frac{\\textrm{Market Value of TCB in 2018 prices}}{\\textrm{Market Value of TCB in 2009 prices}}\\times 100 \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] 5.2.5 How the CPI Is Calculated: Compute the inflation rate The inflation rate for a given year is the percentage increase in the CPI from the preceding period. Equation (5.2) defines the inflation rate: \\[\\begin{equation} \\textrm{Inflation Rate in 2018, Base Year 2009}\\equiv\\frac{\\textrm{CPI for 2018, Base Year 2009} - \\textrm{CPI for 2017, Base Year 2009}}{\\textrm{CPI for 2017, Base Year 2009}}\\times 100 \\tag{5.2} \\end{equation}\\] Note that the inflation rate could be negative, if CPI decreases over time. 5.2.5.1 How the CPI Is Calculated: Example Suppose the Base Year is 2002 Suppose the market value of the Typical Consumers Basket of goods and services (TCB) is $1,200 in 2002 prices Suppose the market value of the same TCB is $1,236 in 2004 prices Then CPI for 2004, Base Year 2002 = $1,236 ÷ $1,200 × 100 = 103 Meaning: Prices increased 3 percent between 2002 and 2004 5.2.5.2 How the CPI Is Calculated: The Basic Idea Lets look at the above example again. Suppose you went to Hawaii on holiday in 2002 and spent $1,200. Suppose you went to Hawaii again in 2004, and paid for exactly the same goods and services as in 2002: the same hotel room, the same meals, the same travel, the same everything. And yet, you find that you spent $1,236 during your 2004 holiday. Now, $1,236 ÷ $1,200 = 1.03, meaning that your 2004 spending was a multiple 1.03 of your 2002 spending, even though you paid for exactly the same things on both holidays. How could that be? The only plausible explanation is that prices in 2004 wereon averagea multiple of 1.03 of the prices in 2002. That is, prices in 2004 were 103 percent of the prices in 2002, on average. Or, equivalently, prices in Hawaii were 3 percent higher in 2004 compared to 2002. In this way, by comparing the market value of a fixed basket of goods at two different dates, one can estimate the overall percentage change in prices between those two dates. This is the basic idea behind the CPI formula in Equation (5.1). 5.2.5.3 How the CPI Is Calculated: Another Example Figure 5.1 presents yet another worked out example of the calculation of the CPI and inflation. Figure 5.1: Worked-out numerical example of the calculation of CPI and inflation from hypothetical data 5.2.5.4 How the CPI Is Calculated: Video Check out this video on the Measurement of Inflation. 5.2.6 Problems in Measuring the Cost of Living The CPI is an accurate measure of the market value of the goods and services that make up the typical consumers basket (TCB), but it is not a perfect measure of the cost of living. Here are some of the reasons why the CPI is nota perfect measure of the cost of living: Substitution bias Introduction of new goods Unmeasured quality changes 5.2.6.1 Problems in Measuring the Cost of Living: Substitution Bias The typical consumers basket (TCB) is not usually changed to reflect consumer reaction to changes in relative prices. Consumers substitute toward goods that become relatively less expensive. The CPI overstates the increase in cost of living by not considering consumer substitution. Consider this hypothetical example: Suppose Red Apples and Green Apples are the only two commodities and are identical except for color. Suppose the typical consumers basket has, for many years, contained 10 of each type. Suppose the prices in 2015 (the base year) were $2 per apple for both types. So, the cost of the typical consumers basket was $40 in 2015 prices. Suppose the prices in 2016 are $4 for a Red Apple and $2 for a Green Apple. So, the cost of the typical consumers basket is $60 in 2016 prices. Therefore, the CPI for 2016 with base year 2015 is 60 ÷ 40 × 100 = 150, indicating a 50% increase in the cost of living from 2015 to 2016. Q: The CPI has increased. But has the cost of living really increased? A: No. The consumer can switch to zero Red Apples and 20 Green Apples and enjoy the same satisfaction in 2016 as in 2015 without any increase in cost. Therefore, we see that the CPI exaggerates the true cost of living. 5.2.6.2 Problems in Measuring the Cost of Living: Introduction of New Goods The typical consumers basket does not reflect the change in purchasing power brought on by the introduction of new products. New products result in greater variety, which in turn makes each dollar more valuable. As a result, consumers need fewer dollars to maintain any given standard of living. 5.2.6.3 Problems in Measuring the Cost of Living: Unmeasured Quality Changes If the quality of a good rises from one year to the next, the value of a dollar rises, even if the price of the good stays the same. If the quality of a good falls from one year to the next, the value of a dollar falls, even if the price of the good stays the same. The BLS tries to adjust the price for changes in quality, but such changes are sometimes hard to measure. The substitution bias, introduction of new goods, and unmeasured quality changes cause the CPI to overstate the true cost of living. The issue is important because many government programs use the CPI to adjust for changes in the overall level of prices. The inflation calculated from the CPI overstates the true increase in the cost of living by about 1 percentage point per year. 5.2.7 The GDP Deflator Versus the Consumer Price Index Economists and policymakers monitor both the GDP deflator and the CPI to gauge how quickly prices are rising. There are, however, two important differences between the indexes. We discussed the GDP deflator in Chapter 4 (Measuring a Nations Income). There we saw that the GDP deflator is calculated by Equation (4.1). A side-by-side comparison of Equations (5.2) and (4.1) shows that: The GDP deflator reflects the prices of all final goods and services produced domestically, whereas the consumer price index reflects the prices of all final goods and services bought by consumers, irrespective of where those goods and services were produced. The Consumer Price Index compares the market value of a fixed basket of goods and services to the price of the basket in the base year (only occasionally does the BLS change the basket) whereas the GDP deflator compares the market value of currently produced final goods and services to the price of the same goods and services in the base year. 5.2.7.1 The GDP Deflator Versus the Consumer Price Index: Exercise If a Pennsylvania gun manufacturer raises the price of rifles it sells to the U.S. Army, its price hikes will increase: Both the CPI and the GDP deflator Neither the CPI nor the GDP deflator The CPI but not the GDP deflator The GDP deflator but not the CPI Despite the conceptual differences between the CPI and the GDP deflator, the inflation numbers that we get from them tend not to be very different, as we see from Figure 5.2. Figure 5.2: Two Measures of Inflation: from CPI and from GDP Deflator 5.3 Correcting Economic Variables For The Effects Of Inflation The CPI is used to correct for the effects of inflation when comparing dollar figures from different dates. (See the BLSs inflation calculator.) Quick Quiz Suppose CPI in 1914 = 10 Suppose CPI in 2012 = 230 Suppose Henry Ford paid his workers $5 a day in 1914 Q: How much is that in 2012 dollars? A: $115 Why? The CPI rose by a multiple of 23 (= 230/10) from 1914 to 2012. So, the 2012 equivalent of the 1914 salary would have to be 23 times higher = $5 × 23 = $115. In general, if you know a dollar amount in year \\(a\\), what is the equivalent dollar amountin purchasing powerin year \\(b\\)? \\[\\begin{equation} \\textrm{Year b amount}=\\textrm{Year a amount}\\times\\frac{\\textrm{CPI in Year b}}{\\textrm{CPI in Year a}} \\tag{5.3} \\end{equation}\\] Quick Quiz Suppose CPI in 1931 = 15.2 Suppose CPI in 2012 = 229.5 Suppose Babe Ruth earned $80,000 in 1931 Q: What 2012 salary in 2012 would have had the same purchasing power as Babe Ruths salary in 1931? Note that prices rose by a multiple of 229.5 ÷ 15.2 = 15.1 over from 1931 to 2012. Therefore, the equivalent salary in 2012 is 15.1 times the 1931 salary, or $80,000 × 15.1 = $1,207,894. Quick Quiz If the consumer price index is 200 in the year 1980 and 300 today, then $600 in 1980 has the same purchasing power as ___ today. $400 $500 $700 $900 5.3.1 Indexation When some dollar amount is automatically corrected for inflation by law or contract, the amount is said to be indexed for inflation. For example, the social security pensions that most US retirees receive is indexed for the inflation rate calculated from the CPI. See a screen-shot from the Social Security Administrations web site in Figure 5.3. Figure 5.3: Social Security Pension Payments in the US are Indexed to the CPI 5.3.2 Correcting Economic Variables For The Effects Of Inflation: Real and Nominal Interest Rates Interest represents a payment in the future for resources borrowed in the past. Conversely, interest represents a receipt in the future for resources loaned in the past. The nominal interest rate is the interest rate usually mentioned in borrowing and lending contracts. It is not corrected for inflation. It is the interest rate that a bank pays. The real interest rate is the interest rate that is corrected for the effects of inflation. The inflation correction is done as in Equation (5.4): \\[\\begin{equation} \\textrm{real interest rate}=\\textrm{nominal interest rate}-\\textrm{inflation rate} \\tag{5.4} \\end{equation}\\] Lets apply this equation: Suppose you borrowed $1,000 for one year. Suppose the nominal interest rate on the loan was 15% Suppose during the year of the loan, inflation was 10% Then, the real interest rate = 15% - 10% = 5% For more insight into this correction, consider the following example. Suppose you loaned $100 to a friend at the nominal interest rate of 15% So, a year later, you will get back $115 Suppose inflation is 10%. In particular, the price of gold increased 10%. Had you instead bought gold with your $100, a year later you could have sold it for $110. So, by lending to your friend, you actually earned $5, over and above inflation. So, real interest rate is 5% Note that the nominal interest rate is usually higher than zero. Would you put your money in a bank that pays -5 percent interest? In that case, if you deposit $100 today, youd have only $95 a year later. Youd be better off keeping your cash in your wallet or under your mattress, where the $100 will remain $100 a year later. For this reason, nominal interest rates are rarely negative. However, the real interest rate can be negative, when the inflation rate exceeds the nominal interest rate, and it often is. Figure 5.4 shows US data on nominal and real interest rates. The nominal interest rate in this case is the 5-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate and the real interest rate is the 5-Year Treasury Inflation-Indexed Security, Constant Maturity. These show the interest rates that lenders to the US Treasury get for 5-year loans. The inflation-indexed interest rate is the real interest rate, as the name suggests. Note that the real interest rate can indeed be negative, on occasion. Figure 5.4: Nominal and Real Interest Rates Quick Quiz You deposit $2,000 in a savings account, and a year later you have $2,100. Meanwhile, the consumer price index rises from 200 to 204. In this case, the nominal interest rate is _____ percent, and the real interest rate is _____ percent. 1; 5 3; 5 5; 1 5; 3 "],["growth.html", "Chapter 6 Production and Growth 6.1 Introduction 6.2 The History of Economic Change 6.3 Productivity 6.4 Goverment Policy Regarding Productivity and Its Growth", " Chapter 6 Production and Growth 6.1 Introduction The solution to a macroeconomic problem depends on whether you want a quick solution or a lasting solution. Consider a president who is trying to ensure a bright future for the country and, thereby, his or her place in history. This president will want to know about long-run economic theories. Now consider a president who is simply trying to get the economy going quickly so he or she will win the next election, which is six months away. This president will want to know about short-run economic theories. In this and the next several chapters, we will look at long run macroeconomic problems and their solutions. We saw in Section 4.6 of Chapter 4 that our best, though imperfect, measure of a countrys standard of living is its real GDP per person (also called real GDP per capita). In this capter, we will focus on real GDP per person and its rate of growth. Specifically, we will discus three main questions: In any given year, there are vast differences in real GDP per personand in its annual rate of growthamong countries. Why? For any given country, real GDP per person can change dramatically over the years. Why? What can be done by macroeconomic policy makers to raise a countrys real GDP per capita permanently?2 6.2 The History of Economic Change 6.2.1 The History of Economic Change: Variation in Real GDP per Person across Countries Lets begin with a look at the data. One source of internationally comparable data is the World Bank. In particular, lets go to the web page for a macroeconomic variable that the World Bank calls GDP per capita, PPP (constant 2011 international $). It is one measure of real GDP per capita. Figure 6.1 shows GDP data for a selected group of countries, in descending order of GDP in 1990. Note the huge variation. Per capita GDP was $110,432.46 in United Arab Emirates, an oil-rich country, and $378.53 in Mozambique. In other words, the average resident of UAE was roughly 290 times richer than the average resident of Mozambiquea mind-boggling thought. Figure 6.1: GDP per capita, and its growth, for selected countries. Source: World Bank Figure 6.2 shows GDP data for the same group of countries, in descending order of GDP in 2017. Note the huge variation. Per capita GDP was $71,809.25 in Brunei Darussalam, another oil-rich country, and $661.24 in Central African Republic. In other words, the average resident of Brunei Darussalam was roughly 109 times richer than the average resident of Central African Republic. The variation is still very high, though a lot less than in 1990. Figure 6.2: GDP per capita, and its growth, for selected countries. Source: World Bank Living standards, as measured by real GDP per person, vary significantly among nations. The United Kingdom is an advanced economy. In 2011, its GDP per person was $36,010. A negligible share of the population lives in extreme poverty, defined here as less than $2 a day. A baby born in the United Kingdom can expect a relatively healthy childhood: Only 5 out of 1,000 children die before reaching age 5. Educational attainment is high: Among children of high school age, 98 percent are in school. Mexico is a middle-income country. In 2011, its GDP per person was $15,390. About 5 percent of the population lives on less than $2 a day, and 16 out of 1,000 children die before age 5. Among those of high school age, 71 percent are in school. Mali is a poor country. In 2011, its GDP per person was only $1,040. Extreme poverty is the norm: More than three-quarters of the population lives on less than $2 per day. Life is often cut short: 176 out of 1,000 children die before age 5. And educational attainment in Mali is low: Among those of high school age, only 31 percent are in school. Video: Basic Facts of Wealth 6.2.2 The History of Economic Change: Real GDP per Capita can Change a Lot over Time Within a country there are large changes in the standard of living over time. This gives us hope that things can get better. It also raises the question: Why do standards of living change over time? Figure 6.3 shows GDP data for the same group of countries we were looking at above, but in descending order of the annual growth rate of real GDP per capita over 1990  2017. Equatorial Guinea, a small African nation that has struck oil relatively recently, is the star performer here. It multiplied its per capita GDP by a multiple of 22.62 during 1990  2017. Real GDP per capita rose dramatically from $999.50 to $22,604.87 in just 27 years. Equivalently, it grew at an annual rate of 12.244 percent during the period. China and Myanmar are also stellar performers. Figure 6.3: GDP per capita, and its growth, for selected countries. Source: World Bank 6.2.3 The History of Economic Change: Growth Rates can vary significantly across countries But note, again, the huge variation in growth rates. While there are the high performers such as Equatorial Guinea, China, and Myanmar, we also have countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo. In DRC, real GDP per capita in 2017 was 0.58 of its 1990 level, falling from $1,386.83 to $808.13. Equivalently, the standard of living in DRC shrank at the annual rate of -1.980 percent throughout the period. What are we to make of all this? Dramatic improvements in living standards are clearly possible. However, growth cannot be taken for granted. Big declines in living standards are also possible. In other words, growth rates vary a great deal from country to country. The question is why? Why do some countries grow fast and others grow slowly (or even shrink, growing at negative rates)? Note in Figure 6.1 that the countries that were rich in 1990 generally did not grow very fast during the subsequent 1990  2017 period, whereas several of the 1990 laggardssuch as Equatorial Guinea, China, India, Vietnam, Myanmar, and Mozambiquegrew quite rapidly in the subsequent period, thereby closing the gap with the front-runners. Is there some lesson in this? Are there reasons why poor countries may find it easier to grow faster and catch up with rich countries? Video: Growth Rates Are Crucial Figure 6.4 shows more data on the huge variation across countries reaching back a hundred years. Figure 6.4: Variation in Growth. Source: Principles of Economics, 8th edition, by N. Gregory Mankiw Lets look specifically at the United States. In the United States, real GDP per person was $4,044 in 1870, and $47,210 in 2010, implying a 1.77 percent annual growth rate, on average, over the 140-year period Now lets look at the poorest countries. These countries have average levels of income that have not been seen in the United States for many decades. We need to ask: What did the poor countries do wrong? What did the USA do right? Another point that jumps out at us in Figure 6.3 and Figure 6.4 is that differences in annual growth rates that seem small become large when compounded for many years.3 This gives us hope. Even small increases in growth rates can have a significant effect in the end. Consider Japan and Australia in Figure 6.3. Australia ($28,658.37) was poorer than Japan ($30,582.43) in 1990. Its growth rate (1.656 percent) was, however, slightly higher than Japans (0.905 percent) during 1990  2017. This slight, less than 1 percentage point, edge, when compounded over 27 years meant that by 2017 the tables had turned: Australias per capita GDP ($44,648.71) was higher than Japans ($39,002.22)! Or, consider UK and USA in Figure 6.4. USA ($4,264 in 2014 dollars) was poorer than UK ($5,117) in 1870. Its growth rate (1.80 percent) was, however, slightly higher than UKs (1.42 percent) during 1870  2014. This slight, less than 0.50 percentage point, edge, when compounded over 144 years meant that by 2014 the tables had turned: USAs per capita GDP ($55,860) was higher than UKs ($39,040)! 6.3 Productivity Productivity is key. Productivity refers to the market value of the goods and services that a worker can produce from each hour of work. Productivity plays a key role in determining living standards for all nations in the world. People in high-productivity countries produce: larger quantities, and things that can be sold at higher prices. 6.3.1 Determinants of Productivity Factors of Production Physical capital per worker Human capital per worker Natural resources per worker Technological knowledge Government Effectiveness Policies 6.3.1.1 Determinants of Productivity: Physical Capital Physical Capital is the stock of equipment and structures that are used to produce goods and services. It includes: Tools used to build or repair things. Computer software Office buildings, factory buildings, shopping malls, schools, etc. Infrastructure, such as roads, railway lines, bridges, etc. Physical capital is a produced or man-made factor of production. Fewer consumer goods mean more physical capital. 6.3.1.2 Determinants of Productivity: Human Capital Human Capital refers to the knowledge and skills that workers acquire through education, training, and experience. Like physical capital, human capital raises a nations ability to produce goods and services. Like physical capital, human capital can be acquired only by sacrificing current consumption. 6.3.1.3 Determinants of Productivity: Natural Resources Natural Resources are inputs used in production that are provided by nature. Examples: land, rivers, and mineral deposits. Renewable resources include trees and forests. Nonrenewable resources include petroleum and coal. Natural Resources can be important but are not absolutely essential for an economy to be highly productive. The search for reserves of natural resources such as petroleum and coal usually requires a sacrifice of current consumption. Are natural resources a limit to economic growth? Not necessarily. Innovation has enabled us to do more and more with less and less. Prices of most natural resources (adjusted for overall inflation) have actually been stable or falling. 6.3.1.4 Determinants of Productivity: Technological Knowledge Technological Knowledge refers to our scientific understanding of the best ways to produce various goods and services. Human capital, which we saw earlier, refers to the resources expended in transmitting this understanding to workers. Increases in technological knowledge require investment in research and development This usually requires a sacrifice of current consumption. Video: The Hockey Stick of Human Prosperity. Video: An Orgy of Innovation. Video: Puzzle of Growth: Rich Countries and Poor Countries. Video: Growth Miracles and Growth Disasters. 6.3.1.5 Determinants of Productivity: Government The availability of physical capital, human capital, natural resources, and technology does not guarantee that these resources will be properly utilized. Government must provide the proper incentives and ensure law and order 6.4 Goverment Policy Regarding Productivity and Its Growth Government policies that raise productivity and living standards include policies that: Encourage saving and investment. Encourage investment from abroad Encourage education and training. Establish secure property rights and maintain political stability. Promote free trade. Promote research and development. Provide and maintain roads, bridges, and other infrastructure. 6.4.1 Goverment Policy Regarding Productivity and Its Growth: Saving and Investment If we use fewer resources to produce consumption goods, we will have more resources to: Produce physical capital Acquire human capital through education Increase our technological knowledge by doing research and development But there is a trade-off: more saving means less current consumption. It is not clear whether the government should encourage individuals to sacrifice current consumption for the sake of a brighter future. Moreover, the accumulation of physical capital is subject to diminishing returns and the catch-up effect. 6.4.1.1 Diminishing Returns and the Catch-up Effect As the stock of capital rises, the extra output produced from an additional unit of capital falls. This property is called diminishing returns. Because of diminishing returns, an increase in the rate of investment in physical capital leads to higher growth only for a while. In the long run, a higher rate of investment in physical capital leads to a higher level of productivity and income, but not to faster growth of productivity and income. Saving and investment must, therefore, be used intelligently, not just to accumulate more and more physical capital, but to pay for education and research on innovation. The catch-up effect implies that poorer countries would grow more rapidly than rich countries that are otherwise similar. From 1960 to 1990, the United States and South Korea devoted a similar share of GDP to investment. Yet the United States experience mediocre annual growth of about 2%, while South Korea experienced spectacular growth of more than 6%. 6.4.2 Goverment Policy Regarding Productivity and Its Growth: Foreign Investment Also, investment (in physical capital, human capital, and technological knowledge) can be done with foreign resources, by removing barriers to foreign investment. However, part of the output produced with the help of foreign investment will, naturally, go to the foreigners who made the investment. Investment from abroad takes several forms: Foreign Direct Investment: Capital investment owned and operated by a foreign entity. Foreign Portfolio Investment: Investments financed with foreign money but operated by domestic residents. It should be clear that foreign investors will take their earningsinterest and profitsback to their own countries. Still, foreign investment creates jobs and raises productivity and wages in the host country. Foreign direct investment is one way for poor countries to learn the use of state-of-the-art technologies. For poor countries, foreign investment may be the only route to progress, especially if their incomes are barely enough to cover their essential consumption needs. To attract foreign investment, governments must: protect the property rights of investors and provide adequate infrastructure (roads, ports, etc) These are, by the way, necessary to attract any kind of productive investment, by domestic entrepreneurs or by foreign entrepreneurs. 6.4.3 Goverment Policy Regarding Productivity and Its Growth: Education For a countrys long-run growth, education is at least as important as investment in physical capital. In the United States, each year of schooling raises a persons wage, on average, by about 10 percent. In poor countries the payoff is even higher. Thus, one way the government can enhance the standard of living is by building schools and providing subsidies to encourage students to acquire education. An educated person might generate new ideas that might expand societys pool of knowledge and provide external benefits to others. When deciding how much education to acquire, the typical individual pays attention to the prospect of earning higher wages, but ignores the external benefits of his education to the rest of society. Therefore, it makes sense for the government to give individuals a subsidy as an extra incentive to go to school. One problem facing some poor countries is the brain drainthe emigration of many of the most highly educated workers to rich countries. If the recipient of education subsidies in a poor country emigrates to a rich country, the poor country loses its investment and the rich country gains a worker who was educated at another countrys expense 6.4.4 Goverment Policy Regarding Productivity and Its Growth: Health and Nutrition Less healthy workers are less productive. Less healthy workers impose an external cost on the rest of society: they can infect others. As a result, countries can get caught in a vicious cycle. This provides a justification for government efforts to encourage saving and investment to push economic growth. 6.4.4.1 Robert Fogels Research In Great Britain in 1780, about one in five people were so malnourished that they couldnt do manual labor. As nutrition improved, so did productivity. The causation probably runs both ways: better nutrition makes us more productive and higher productivity makes better nutrition affordable. As nations get richer, people eat more, and the population gets taller. From 1775 to 1975, the average caloric intake in Great Britain rose by 26 percent, and the height of the average man rose by 3.6 inches. From 1962 to 1995, the average caloric intake in South Korea rose by 44 percent, and the height of the average man rose by 2 inches. Studies have found that height is an indicator of productivity. Taller workers tend to earn more, especially in poor countries. 6.4.5 Goverment Policy Regarding Productivity and Its Growth: Property Rights and Political Stability Property rights refer to the ability of people to exercise authority over the resources they own. Enforcement of property rights is an important prerequisite for the free-market system to work. It is necessary for investors to feel that their investments are secure. This requires a stable political and judicial system. 6.4.6 Goverment Policy Regarding Productivity and Its Growth: Free Trade Trade is, in some ways, a type of technology. A country that eliminates trade restrictions will experience the same kind of economic growth that would occur after a major technological advance. Suppose a countrys opportunity cost of a ton of wheat is 5 tons of rice. If this country can import a ton of wheat by exporting 3 tons of rice, it is as if the countrys technology has improved. Trade policies can be: inward-orientated, avoiding interaction with other countries. outward-orientated, encouraging interaction with other countries. A country that adopts inward-oriented policies will have to make everything it needs, including the things it cant produce efficiently. 6.4.6.1 Trade and Geography A countries access to global trade depends not only on government policy but also on geography. Countries with natural seaports find it easier to trade and prosper. Many of the worlds major cities are located close to oceans. Africa has suffered because many of its countries are landlocked. Video: Geography and Economic Growth. 6.4.7 Goverment Policy Regarding Productivity and Its Growth: Research and Development The advance of technological knowledge has led to higher standards of living. Most technological advance comes from research by private firms and individual inventors. Government can encourage the development of new technologies through research grants, tax breaks, and the patent system. New knowledge has external benefits. Private researchers will consider only the gains that they can get from their innovations; they will ignore the external benefits their research creates for the rest of society. Therefore, it makes sense for the government to subsidize or fully fund research, especially on basic or fundamental science that is valuable to society but will not be done by private businesses 6.4.8 Goverment Policy Regarding Productivity and Its Growth: Population Growth Population growth affects the per capita availability of other factors of production: Stretching natural resources (-ve) Diluting the capital stock (-ve) Promoting technological progress (+ve) The overall effect of population growth on economic growth is therefore ambiguous. It is, therefore, unclear what the government should do about population growth. 6.4.8.1 Population Growth: Stretching Natural Resources Thomas Malthus (17661834) had argued that, because of diminishing returns in agriculture, food production could not keep pace with population growth, leading to widespread famines. Boy was he wrong! Although the worlds population has increased six fold over the past two centuries, living standards are on average much higher today. Diminishing returns lost out to human ingenuity. 6.4.8.2 Population Growth: Diluting the Capital Stock If each family has a large number of children, it would be difficult to: Educate them all. The kids may grow up with less human capital, as a result. equip them all with the necessary physical capital. 6.4.8.3 Population Growth: Promoting Technological Progress If there are more people: There are more scientists, inventors, and engineers to contribute to technological advance There is a larger market for innovative goods. This increases the incentive to innovate Over the broad span of human history, the worlds rate of economic growth has increased as world population has. As you can see, population growth can affect productivity in complicated ways. Partly for these reasons, different countries have adopted different stances on population growth. China restricts families to just one child. (Some people may consider this to be an unacceptable reduction of human freedom.) Some countries, such as Singapore, have gone the other way to encourage women, through financial incentives, to have more kids. 6.4.9 Goverment Policy Regarding Productivity and Its Growth: Its Crucial! What Makes a Nation Rich? According to Daron Acemoglu, an MIT economist, the answer is Government! Poor people are poor because they made the wrong choices. They make wrong choices because governments gave them the wrong incentives. If you fix government youll fix poverty. The Mexico-USA border fence splits Nogales into two halves that are identical in every way except government. Median household income is $30,000 on the USA side and $10,000 on the Mexico side. China has been transformed in recent decades pretty much entirely because government policies have changed. Video: The Importance of Institutions. Unless otherwise mentioned, by gross domestic product I will mean real (that is, inflation-adjused) gross domestic product, throughout the rest of this book. Compounding refers to the accumulation of a growth rate over a period of time.

We also discussed whether the government could  or should  influence or control an economys levels of saving and investment. In this chapter, we will take a closer look at these questions. Specifically, we will describe the theory of loanable funds, which is the standard long-run theory of saving and investment, for a closed economy.4 7.2 Saving, Investment, and the Financial System We all know what saving means. If you earn an income of $50,000 a year and spend $40,000 on various kinds of consumption, then your saving is $10,000. If your income is $50,000 and your consumption is $70,000, then your saving is -$20,000. Lets consider the first of the two examples in the previous paragraph. Her income is $50,000 and her consumption spending is $40,000. What exactly does she do with the $10,000 that she saved? Stick it under a mattress? Most likely, no. She may have deposited the money in a bank account. In that case, she probably got a receipt. That receipt is a financial asset. She could go back to the bank at some time in the future and use her receipt to reclaim her money. She may have bought bonds or stocks or some other financial asset with the $10,000 she had saved. She could sell her financial assets at some time in the future in exchange for the sale value. My point is that saving involves lending and is simply the sale of loanable funds and the purchase of financial assets. In Section 4.4.1 of Chapter 4, investment was defined as: the purchase of goods (called capital goods) that will be used in the future to produce more goods and services. Investment is the sum of purchases of business capital, residential capital, and inventories. In short, investment is spending by businesses on equipment, structures, and software, and spending by households on new homes. Spending on these things is often paid for with borrowed money. Those who wish to buy a building of some sort may get a loan from a bank. Businesses that need to expand their production or R&amp;D efforts may sell bonds or stocks. In all these cases, the borrower takes cash from the lender and hands over a receipt or financial asset of some kind. So, investment involves borrowing and is simply purchase of loanable funds and the sale of financial assets. You are no doubt familiar with the theory of supply and demand. You no doubt know that economists use that theory to explore the buying and selling of various goods and services. For any traded commodity, the theory imagines a demand curve which shows how buyers respond to the price of the commodity, and a supply curve which shows how sellers respond to the price of the commodity. The intersection of the two curves then determines the equilibrium price of the commodity and the equilibrium quantity bought and sold. As saving is the sale of loanable funds and investment is the purchase of loanable funds, in this chapter, I can  and I will  use the theory of supply and demand to analyze the market for loanable funds. The market for loanable funds is sometimes called the financial system. The theory of supply and demand, when used to analyze the market for loanable funds, is called the theory of loanable funds. To apply the theory of supply and demand to the market for loanable funds, we need to specify a price for the loanable funds that are supplied by lenders (savers) and demanded by borrowers (investors). That price is the interest rate. Just as a supplier of ice cream sees the price of ice cream as her compensation for providing ice cream to the buyer, the lender sees the interest rate as her compensation for letting someone else use her money for the period of the loan. Just as the buyer of ice cream sees the price as the sacrifice made for the consumption of ice cream, the borrower sees the interest rate as the sacrifice made for the use of another persons money for the period of the loan. We are now ready to apply the theory of supply and demand to study the market for loanable funds. 7.3 The Financial System The financial system consists of the institutions in the economy that help to match households saving with firms investment. It moves the economys scarce resources from savers to investors (or, from lenders to borrowers). 7.3.1 Financial Institutions In The U.S. Economy Financial institutions can be grouped into two categories: financial markets: these are the institutions through which savers can directly provide funds to borrowers. Financial Markets include: Stock Market Bond Market financial intermediaries: these are financial institutions through which savers can indirectly provide funds to borrowers. Financial Intermediaries include: Banks Mutual Funds 7.3.1.1 Financial Markets: The Bond Market A bond is a certificate of indebtedness that specifies obligations of the borrower to the holder of the bond. The sale of bonds to raise money is called debt financing. Characteristics of a Bond: Term: The length of time until the bond matures. Credit Risk: The probability that the borrower will fail to pay some of the interest or principal. Tax Treatment: The way in which the tax laws treat the interest on the bond. Municipal bonds are federal tax exempt. 7.3.1.2 Financial Markets: The Stock Market Stock represents a claim to partial ownership in a firm and is therefore, a claim to the profits that the firm makes. The sale of stock to raise money is called equity financing. Compared to bonds, stocks offer both higher risk and potentially higher returns. The most important stock exchanges in the United States are the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, and NASDAQ. Most newspaper stock tables provide the following information: Price (of a share) Volume (number of shares sold) Dividend (profits paid to stockholders) Price-earnings ratio 7.3.1.3 Financial Intermediaries: Banks Banks take deposits from people who want to save and use the deposits to make loans to people who want to borrow. Banks pay depositors interest on their deposits and charge borrowers slightly higher interest on their loans. Banks help create money by allowing people to write checks against their deposits. Money is anything that people can easily use as payment in transactions. This facilitates the purchases of goods and services. 7.3.1.4 Financial Intermediaries: Mutual Funds A mutual fund sells shares to the public and uses the proceeds to buy various types of stocks, bonds, and other financial assets. The profits/losses are shared with the shareholders. Mutual funds enable people with small amounts of money to easily diversify. 7.4 Saving And Investment In The National Income Accounts Recall from Equation (4.4) that GDP is both total income in an economy and total expenditure on the economys output of goods and services: \\(Y = C + I + G + NX\\). In this chapter we assume a closed economy, which is one that does not engage in international trade. In such an economy, net exports is necessarily zero: \\(NX = 0\\). Therefore, \\(Y = C + I + G + NX\\) becomes \\(Y = C + I + G\\). Now, subtract \\(C\\) and \\(G\\) from both sides of the equation to get \\(Y  C  G = I\\). 7.4.1 Saving = Investment \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\textrm{National Saving} &amp;=&amp; \\textrm{Private Saving} + \\textrm{Public Saving}\\\\ S &amp;=&amp; S_p + S_g. \\tag{7.1} \\end{eqnarray}\\] 7.5 Budget Surplus and Budget Deficit If \\(T &gt; G\\), the government runs a budget surplus because it receives more money than it spends. \\(T  G\\) represents public saving. If \\(G &gt; T\\), the government runs a budget deficit because it spends more money than it receives in tax revenue. Fun fact: In the 2013 fiscal year, the US federal government ran a budget deficit of $680 billion (or, 4.1 percent of the GDP of the United States). 7.6 The market for loanable funds We have just seen that the amount of saving must be equal to the amount of investment. But what about desired saving and desired investment? They must be equal to their corresponding actual amounts, as households and businesses cannot be forced to do what they dont want to do. So, what makes desired saving equal to desired investment? For the economy as a whole, desired saving must be equal to desired investment: \\[\\begin{equation} S = I \\tag{7.2} \\end{equation}\\] This is achieved in the market for loanable funds. You have seen how the buyers desired quantity of ice cream is made equal to the sellers desired quantity of ice cream in the ice cream market. A similar process in the market for loanable funds makes desired saving equal to desired investment. The market for loanable funds is the market in which: The supply of loans come from households with savings The demand for loans come from businesses (and households) that wish to spend for investment The price of loans reaches an equilibrium at which the supply of loans becomes equal to the demand for loans The process is not unlike what goes on in other markets, such as the market for ice cream. Financial markets work much like other markets in the economy. The equilibrium of the supply and demand for loanable funds determines the real interest rate. The real interest rate is the price of a loan. It represents the amount that borrowers to take a loan and the amount that lenders receive to make a loan. More precisely, the price of a loan is the real interest rate. The real interest rate is the inflation-adjusted interest rate. real interest rate = nominal interest rate  inflation rate 7.7 Government Policies can affect Saving and Investment Taxes can affect saving Taxes can affect investment Government budgets can affect saving 7.7.1 Policy 1: Saving Incentives The interest earned on savings is considered taxable income. Taxes on interest income substantially reduce the future payoff from current saving. As a result, such taxes reduce the incentive to save. An income tax cut increases the incentive for households to save, at any given interest rate. The supply curve of loanable funds shifts to the right. The equilibrium interest rate decreases. The quantity of saving and investment increases. 7.7.2 Policy 2: Investment Incentives Businesses pay taxes on their profits. The government may reduce a firms profits tax on the condition that it spends more on investment. This is called an investment tax credit. An investment tax credit increases the incentive firms have to borrow for investment purposes. So, it: Shifts the demand curve for loanable funds to the right. The interest rate increases and saving and investment increase as well. 7.7.3 Policy 3: Government Budget Deficits and Surpluses When the government spends more than it receives in tax revenues, \\(T  G &lt; 0\\). The gap is called the budget deficit. The government must borrow money in the market for loanable funds to fill the gap. The accumulation of past budget deficits is called the government debt. Government borrowing to pay for its budget deficit reduces the supply of loanable funds available to pay for investment by households and firms (the private sector). This fall in investment is referred to as crowding out. The budget deficit borrowing crowds out private borrowers who are trying to find loans for investment. An increase in the budget deficit decreases the supply of loanable funds. The supply curve of loanable funds shifts to the left. The interest rate increases. Saving and investment decrease. Conversely, an increase in the budget surplus increases the supply of loanable funds, reduces the interest rate, and increases the quantity of saving and investment. 7.8 Should a Nations Government Try to Change Its Levels of Saving and Investment? Theres no clear answer. More saving and investment is not always good for us. While the future is important, so is the present. While saving and investment improve our future standard of living, they reduce our current standard of living. The level of saving and investment that comes out of the interactions of savers and investors in the market for loanable funds is usuallythough not alwaysjust right. So, the government should intervene only when: It is clear that the market is likely to malfunction, and The government is reasonably sure that it would be able to do a better job than the market A closed economy is one in which the residents have no economic contactno buying and selling of goods and services, no borrowing and lending of funds, no migration, nothingwith foreigners. Ans economy that is not closed is called an open economy. We will discuss the macroeconomics of open economies in other chapters.

It is a stark indication of economic inefficiency, besides being a serious human problem for the unemployed. The problem of unemployment is usually seen as two separate problems: The long-run problem, which focuses on reducing the natural rate of unemployment, and the short-run problem, which focuses on reducing the cyclical rate of unemployment. Natural unemployment is unemployment that does not go away on its own even in the long run. It is the amount of unemployment that the economy normally experiences. This chapter focuses on the natural rate of unemployment. Cyclical unemployment refers to the fluctuations in unemployment around its natural rate. It is associated with with short-term ups and downs of the business cycle. This chapter ignores cyclical unemployment. 9.2 The Data on Unemployment In looking at the data on unemployment, I will focus on three basic questions: 1. How does government measure unemployment? 2. What problems arise in interpreting the unemployment data? 3. How long are the unemployed typically without work? 9.2.1 The Data on Unemployment: How Is Unemployment Measured? In the US, unemployment is measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). It surveys 60,000 randomly selected households every month. The survey is called the Current Population Survey. Based on the answers to the survey questions, the BLS places each adult into one of three categories: Employed Unemployed Not in the labor force Note that: Labor force = employed + unemployed Adult population = labor force + not in the labor force The BLS considers a person an adult if he or she is over 16 years old. An adult is considered employed if he or she has spent most of the previous week working at a paid job. An adult is considered unemployed if he or she: is on temporary layoff, is looking for a job, or is waiting for the start date of a new job. A person who is neither employed nor unemployed is not in the labor force. Examples include: a full-time student, a homemaker, or a retiree. The unemployment rate is the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed. The labor-force participation rate is the percentage of the adult population that is in the labor force. 9.2.2 The Data on Unemployment: Does the Unemployment Rate Measure What We Want It To? It is difficult to distinguish between a person who is unemployed and a person who is not in the labor force. Discouraged workers, people who would like to work but have given up looking for jobs after an unsuccessful search, dont show up in unemployment statistics. Other people may claim to be unemployed in order to receive financial assistance, even though they arent looking for work. 9.2.3 The Data on Unemployment: How Long Are the Unemployed without Work? Most spells of unemployment are short. Most unemployment observed at any given time is long-term. Most of the economys unemployment problem is attributable to relatively few workers who are jobless for long periods of time. 9.3 Why Are There Always Some People Unemployed? 9.3.1 The Ideal Labor Market In an ideal labor market, wages would adjust to balance the supply and demand for labor, ensuring that all workers are fully employed. 9.3.2 Frictional unemployment Frictional unemployment refers to the unemployment that results from the time that it takes to match workers with jobs. It takes time for workers to search for the jobs that best suit their tastes and skills. This unemployment occurs even when labor supply equals labor demand. Job search: is the process by which workers find appropriate jobs given their tastes and skills. it results from the fact that it takes time for qualified individuals to be matched with appropriate jobs. Frictional unemployment: It is not caused by a wage rate higher than equilibrium. It is caused by the time spent searching for the right job. Search unemployment is inevitable because the economy is always changing. Changes in the composition of demand among industries or regions are called sectoral shifts. It takes time for workers to search for and find jobs in new sectors. 9.3.2.1 Public Policy and Job Search Government programs can affect the time it takes unemployed workers to find new jobs. These programs include the following: Government-run employment agencies Public training programs Unemployment insurance Government-run employment agencies give out information about job vacancies in order to match workers and jobs more quickly. Public training programs aim to ease the transition of workers from declining to growing industries and to help disadvantaged groups escape poverty. Unemployment insurance is a government program that partially protects workers incomes when they become unemployed. Offers workers partial protection against job losses. Offers partial payment of former wages for a limited time to those who are laid off. Unemployment insurance increases the amount of search unemployment. It reduces the search efforts of the unemployed. It may improve the chances of workers being matched with the right jobs. 9.3.3 Structural unemployment Structural unemployment is the unemployment that results because the number of jobs available in some labor markets is insufficient to provide a job for everyone who wants one. Structural unemployment occurs when the wage is stuck at a level higher than the equilibrium wage. Structural unemployment exists when the wage is higher than the equilibrium wage. So, who keeps the wage that high? It could be: The government (minimum-wage laws) The workers (union activity) The businesses themselves (efficiency wages) 9.3.3.1 Structural unemployment: MINIMUM-WAGE LAWS When the minimum wage is set above the level that balances supply and demand, it creates unemployment. This does not mean that minimum-wage laws are necessarily bad, only that they cause unemployment. In 2009, of those workers paid an hourly rate, 4% of men and 6% of women reported wages at or below the prevailing federal minimum wage. Reported wages can be below the minimum wage because (i) some workers are not covered by the law, (ii) enforcement is imperfect, and (iii) some workers round down the wages they report Minimum-wage workers tend to be young. About half of all workers earning the minimum wage or less were under age 25, and about one-fourth were age 16-19. Among employed teenagers, 19% earned the minimum wage or less, compared with 3% or workers age 25 and older. Minimum-wage workers tend to be less educated. Among workers paid by the hour and age 16 and older, about 10% of those without a high school diploma earned the minimum wage or less, compared with about 4% of those with a high school diploma (but no college), and about 3% of those with a college degree. Minimum-wage workers are more likely to be working part time. Among part-time workers (those who usually work less than 35 hours per week), 11% earned the minimum wage or less, compared to 2% of full-time workers. The leisure and hospitality industry had the highest proportion of workers earning the minimum wage or less (21%). About half of all workers earning the minimum wage or less were in this industry. However, many of these workers earn tips in addition to their hourly wages. The proportion of workers earning the minimum wage or less has fallen since 1979. 9.3.3.2 Structural unemployment: UNIONS AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING A labor union is a worker association that bargains with employers over wages and working conditions. In the 1940s and 1950s, when labor unions were at their peak, about a third of the U.S. labor force was unionized. A labor union is a type of cartel attempting to exert its market power. The process by which labor unions and firms agree on the terms of employment is called collective bargaining. A strike is organized when a union and a firm cannot reach an agreement. A strike refers to when the union organizes a withdrawal of labor from the firm. A successful strike makes some workers better off and other workers worse off. Workers in unions (insiders) reap the benefits of collective bargaining, while workers not in the union (outsiders) bear some of the costs. By acting as a cartel with ability to strike or otherwise impose high costs on employers, unions usually achieve above-equilibrium wages for their members. Union workers earn 10 to 20 percent more than nonunion workers. Their fringe benefits are typically worth two to four times as much. The financial advantage is even greater for workers with little formal education and training and for women, blacks, and Hispanic workers. More than 85 percent of union members have health insurance, compared with 57 percent of non-union workers. Are Unions Good or Bad for the Economy? Critics argue that unions cause the allocation of labor to be inefficient and inequitable. Wages above the competitive level reduce the quantity of labor demanded and cause unemployment. Some workers benefit at the expense of other workers. Advocates of unions contend that unions are a necessary antidote to the market power of firms that hire workers. They claim that unions are important for helping firms respond efficiently to workers concerns. 9.3.3.3 Structural unemployment: THE THEORY OF EFFICIENCY WAGES Efficiency wages are above-equilibrium wages paid by firms in order to increase worker productivity. The theory of efficiency wages states that firms operate more efficiently if wages are above the equilibrium level. A firm may prefer higher-than-equilibrium wages for the following reasons: Worker Health: Better paid workers eat a better diet and thus are more productive. Worker Turnover: A higher paid worker is less likely to look for another job. Worker Effort: Higher wages motivate workers to put forward their best effort. Worker Quality: Higher wages attract a better pool of workers to apply for jobs. 9.3.3.3.1 Structural unemployment: THE THEORY OF EFFICIENCY WAGES: Henry Fords experiment Henry Ford introduced the assembly line technique in auto production, thereby ushering in a productivity revolution. In 1914, Ford began paying his workers $5 per day, which was far above the norm. It is $105 per day in 2007 money. Turnover and absenteeism fell. Productivity rose so much that Fords costs fell. Henry Ford himself called the $5-a-day wage one of the finest cost-cutting moves we ever made.

Every asset has some amount of liquidity. Liquidity is the ease with which an asset can be converted into the economys medium of exchange. As money is the economys medium of exchange, it is the most liquid of all assets. 10.1.2 The Meaning of Money: Kinds of Money Commodity money: Takes the form of a commodity with intrinsic value Examples: gold coins, cigarettes in POW camps Fiat money: Money without intrinsic value, used as money because of government decree Example: the U.S. dollar 10.1.3 The Meaning of Money: Money in the U.S. Economy The quantity of money in an economy needs to be measured. A basic measure, M1, is obtained by adding: Currency: the paper bills and coins in the hands of the public Demand deposits: balances in bank accounts that depositors can use as payment by writing a check. And a few other less important assets, such as travelers checks. Nowadays, M2 is more widely used. Monetary Variables, February 2018 ($ Billions) Currency 1,540.3 + Travelers Checks 1.9 + Demand Deposits 1,474 + Other Checkable Deposits 597.9 = M1 3,614 + Savings Deposits 9,121.9 + Small-denomination Time Deposits 415.8 + Retail Money Market Mutual Funds 706.6 = M2 13,858.3 Video: What Is Money?, Marginal Revolution University, YouTube, July 18, 2017 10.2 THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM The Federal Reserve (The Fed) serves as the central bank of the US. It is designed to oversee the banking system. It regulates the quantity of money in the economy. This activity of a central bank is called monetary policy. 10.2.1 The Federal Reserve System: Helicopter and Vacuum Cleaner You can think of the Fed as printing money and dropping it from helicopters, thereby adding to the quantity of money in the economy. Conversely, you can think of the Fed as a giant vacuum cleaner that sucks money out of peoples wallets, thereby reducing the quantity of money. The helicopter-and-vacuum view of the Fed is a bit too simple, however. The Fed really can increase or decrease the quantity of money. But it does so using a process called open market operations. When the Fed wishes to increase the quantity of money in the economy, it prints money and buys financial assetssuch as government bondson the open market. Thats the Fed acting as a money-dropping helicopter. Like other central banks, the Fed, as the US central bank is called, has the authority to print currency. But newly printed currency notes would have no effect on the economy if they simply sat in a Fed vault; the new notes would have to somehow get into peoples hands and then get used in transactions like all the other currency notes printed before. The Fed could get its newly printed notes into peoples hands by simply dropping the newly printed money all over the country from helicopters. But it doesnt do that. Instead, what the Fed has traditionally done is go to Wall Street with its newly printed dollars and buy short-term US Treasury Bonds, which are widely considered the safest of safe assets. The newly printed notes would then get into the hands of those who sold the bonds to the Fed. The new money would then begin to go from hand to hand to hand in the normal way. When the Fed wishes to decrease the quantity of money in the economy, it sells financial assetssuch as the government bonds it may have bought on an earlier occasionon the open market, and burns the money it gets from the sale. Thats the Fed acting as a money-sucking vacuum. 10.3 BANKS AND THE MONEY SUPPLY Commercial banks can also increase or decrease the economys quantity of money. That is, banks too can act like a money-dropping helicopter or a money-sucking vacuum. Remember that the quantity of money consists of: Currency: the paper bills and coins in the hands of the public Demand deposits: balances in bank accounts that depositors can use as payment by writing a check. Banks can control the quantity of money by controlling that second component: the quantity of demand deposits. 10.3.1 Banks, in brief Households and businesses rely on banks to keep their money safe when the money is not needed for some purchase. These households and businesses are the banks depositors and the money they keep in banks are the banks deposits. Banks may borrow money from sources other than their depositors. This is the banks debt. So, the total amount borrowed by a bankreferred to as the banks liabilitiesincludes both deposits and debt. \\[\\begin{equation} \\textrm{Liabilities} = \\textrm{Deposits} + \\textrm{Debt} \\tag{10.1} \\end{equation}\\] Finally, a banks capital  or owners equity  is the money the banks owners have made available for use by the banks managers. Therefore, a banks funds include its deposits, its debt, and its capital. \\[\\begin{equation} \\textrm{Funds} = \\textrm{Deposits} + \\textrm{Debt} + \\textrm{Capital} \\tag{10.2} \\end{equation}\\] A bank may use its funds to lend money to households and firms who come to it asking for money. These are the banks loans. At any given moment a bank may have some of its funds sitting in its vaults. These are the banks reserves. Finally, a bank may have used some of its funds to buy various assets (perhaps in the hope of selling those assets later at a profit). These are the banks securities purchases. The sum of a banks loans, securities purchases, and reserves is called the banks assets. \\[\\begin{equation} \\textrm{Assets} = \\textrm{Loans} + \\textrm{Securities Purchases} + \\textrm{Reserves} \\tag{10.3} \\end{equation}\\] A banks assets would need to be equal to its funds. Therefore, for an individual bank or for the banking industry as a whole, \\[\\begin{equation} \\textrm{Assets} = \\textrm{Liabilities} + \\textrm{Capital} \\tag{10.4} \\end{equation}\\] A few more definitions  The reserve ratio is the fraction of total deposits in banks that banks hold as reserves. Lets denote this ratio by the symbol \\(R\\). So, \\(R = \\textrm{reserves}/\\textrm{deposits}\\). Now, a countrys central bank is required to boss around regulate its banks. As part of its regulatory activities, central banks typically require baks to keep a minimum level of reserves so that the banks depositors do not have to face a situation where they turn up at a bank to withdraw cash only to be told that all of the depositors money has been loaned out. The fraction of its total deposits that a bank is required by the central bank to keep as reserves is called the required reserve ratio. Lets denote it by the symbol \\(ReqR\\). Note that \\(ReqR \\le R\\). When banks hold reserves in excess of the required reserves, those reserves are called excess reserves. Lets call the fraction of its deposits that a bank holds as excess reserves its excess reserve ratio and denote it \\(ExcR\\). Therefore, \\[\\begin{equation} \\textrm{Reserves} = \\textrm{Required Reserves} + \\textrm{Excess Reserves} \\tag{10.5} \\end{equation}\\] or, in brief, \\[\\begin{equation} R = ReqR + ExcR \\tag{10.6} \\end{equation}\\] 10.3.2 Banks and the money supply When banks make new loans faster than their borrowers repay old loans, the quantity demand deposits increases and, therefore, the economys quantity of money increases. That is, banks can act like a money-dropping helicopter. When banks make new loans slower than their borrowers repay old loans, the quantity of demand deposits decreases and, therefore, the economys quantity of money decreases. That is, banks can act like a money-sucking vacuum. 10.3.3 Banks and the Money Supply: Fractional-Reserve Banking Now consider this silly example: The Fed prints $10,000 and pays Alex, a caterer, who provided food at a Fed function. M1 increases by $10,000. (Why?) Alex deposits the $10,000 cash in Bank A. M1 is unchanged. (Why?) Bank As reserves increase and it decides to make a $9,000 loan out of the new reserves to Barbara. Barbara, the recipient of Bank As loan, buys a car from Chris. Chris deposits $9,000 cash in his account at Bank B. M1 increases by $9,000. (Why?) So far, the Feds printing of $10,000 has already increased M1 by $19,000. And further increases in the money supply may follow when Bank B reacts to Chriss deposit the way Bank A reacted to Alexs deposit. When a bank loans money to someone, that money generally ends up as a deposit in a second bank. This creates more deposits and more reserves to be lent out by that second bank. When the second bank makes a loan from its reserves, the money supply increases again. And the process continues  10.3.4 Banks and the Money Supply: The Money Multiplier How much money is eventually created in this economy? The money multiplier is the name given to the amount of money the banking system generatesby way of the chain reaction or domino effect described in the previous sectionwith each dollar of money created by the central bank. Lets denote it by the symbol \\(mm\\). The money multiplier can be shown to be the reciprocal of the reserve ratio: \\[\\begin{equation} mm = \\frac{1}{R} \\tag{10.7} \\end{equation}\\] Example: With a reserve ratio of R = 20% or 1/5, the money multiplier is 5. In this case, if the Fed prints a new dollar bill and buys a government bond with it, the money supply may increase by as much as $5.00! Video: The Money Multiplier, Marginal Revolution University, YouTube, July 25, 2017 10.4 THE FEDS TOOLS OF MONETARY CONTROL A central bank can affect a nations quantity of money in various ways. It: Influences the quantity of reserves by Open-market operations Fed lending to banks Influences the reserve ratio by Reserve requirements Interest on reserves 10.4.1 Open-market operations This consists of the purchase and sale of government bonds by the central bank. To increase the money supply the central bank buys government bonds (with newly printed cash). To decrease the money supply the central bank sells government bonds. 10.4.2 Central banks lending to banks The discount rate is the interest rate on the loans that the Fed makes to banks. A higher discount rate reduces the money supply. A lower discount rate increases the money supply. The Term Auction Facility is another way the Fed lends money to banks. The Fed sets a quantity of funds it wants to lend to banks. Eligible banks then bid to borrow those funds. Loans go to the highest eligible bidders. To be eligible, bans must have acceptable collateral. 10.4.3 Tools of Monetary Control: Reserve requirements We saw earlier that there are central bank regulations on the minimum amount of reserves that banks must hold (reserve requirements). An increase in the reserve requirement decreases the money supply. Conversely, a decrease in the reserve requirement increases the money supply. However, nowadays reserve requirements are rarely used. 10.4.4 Tools of Monetary Control: Paying interest on reserves Since October 2008during a major financial crisis in the USthe Fed began the practice of paying interest to banks on the reserves the banks held. This gave the Fed a new tool to influence the behavior of banks. The higher the interest rate paid by the Fed on banks reserves the more reserves the banks will choose to hold. This would increase the banks reserve ratio (\\(R\\uparrow\\)). Therefore, the money multiplier would decrease (\\(mm\\downarrow\\)). Therefore, the money supply would decrease (\\(M\\downarrow\\)). Heres data on the interest rate on excess reserves paid by the Fed: IOER. 10.4.5 Tools of Monetary Control: Difficulties in Controlling the Money Supply A central banks control of the money supply is not precise. The central bank cannot avoid two problems that arise due to fractional-reserve banking. The central bank does not control the amount of money that households choose to hold as deposits in banks. The central bank does not control the amount of money that bankers choose to lend. If people lose confidence in the banking system and decide to withdraw cash from their bank accounts and keep the cash at home, the banks would be forced to cut back on their lending. This would cause the money supply to decrease. This is not mere theory: it actually happened during the Great Depression of the 1930s. If banks lose confidence in the economy they may be afraid to lend, fearing that in a bad economy borrowers would default on their loans. So, banks may decide to make fewer loans and hold more reserves. The rise in the reserve ratio (\\(R\\uparrow\\)) would reduce the money multiplier (\\(mm\\downarrow\\)) and cause the money supply to decrease (\\(M\\downarrow\\)). Again, this actually happened during the Great Depression of the 1930s. During the Great Depression both of the above factors were in play: people withdrew cash from their bank accounts and banks were afraid to lend. From 1929 to 1933, the US money supply fell by 28 percent, even though the Federal Reserve did not take any deliberate action to reduce the money supply. This emphasizes the point that a central banks control of the money supply is imprecise. 10.4.6 Feds Tools of Monetary Control: The Federal Funds Rate The Federal Funds Rate is the interest rate that banks charge for overnight loans to one another. When the federal funds rate rises or falls, other interest rates often move in the same direction. When these other interest rates change they affect the behavior of consumers and businesses. This, in turn, has short-run effects on the economy. In recent years, the Fed has used its policy tools to control the Federal Funds Rate. From time to time the Fed announces a target level for the federal funds rate. The Fed then uses its monetary policy tools to push the federal funds rate to the target level. The theory of how a central bank can control interest rates and why it does so will be discussed further when we discuss short-run monetary economics. But heres a brief overview: To raise the fed funds rate, the Fed sells government bonds (open market operations). This removes reserves from the banking system, reduces supply of federal funds, causes the fed funds rate to rise. Conversely, the Fed buys bonds (with newly printed money) to reduce the fed funds rate. Note that the fed funds rate and the money supply move in opposite directions.

In chapter 6 we saw how the price level and its rate of inflation are defined and measured. In this chapter, we will see that the quantity of money determines the price level. The central idea of this chapter is the quantity theory of money. It explains the long-run determinants of the price level and the inflation rate. More specifically, in this chapter, we will see that: The quantity of money in an economy determines its price level, and The growth rate of the quantity of money determines the growth rate of the price level Recall that the growth rate of the price level is also called the rate of inflation Over the past 70 years, prices have risen on average about 4 percent per year in the U.S. Deflation, meaning decreasing average prices, occurred in the U.S. in the nineteenth century. The price level was 23% lower in 1896 than in 1880. In the 1970s prices rose by 7 percent per year. During the 1990s, prices rose at an average rate of 2 percent per year. Hyperinflation refers to very high rates of inflation, usually more than 50 percent per month. At such rates, prices increase more than 100-fold in one year. Germany experienced hyperinflation in the 1920s. The price of a newspaper rose from 0.30 mark in January 1921 to 70,000,000 marks in November 1923 (that is, in less than three years). This does not mean that Germans suddenly felt that newspapers were incredibly wonderful things! Instead, what this means is that money became less valuable to Germans. We see from this example that price increases have more to do with the value of money than with the value of goods. Therefore, if we understand the value of money, we will understand the prices of goods 11.3 The Classical Theory of Inflation This is the mainstream theory of the overall price level and the rate of inflation in the long run. It is called classical because it was developed by some of the earlies economic thinkers. When the overall price level rises, the price of money falls. Suppose the price of a gallon of ice-cream is $5. Then, the price of a dollar is 1/5 gallons of ice-cream. In general, let \\(P\\) denote the price level of goods and services. So, \\(P\\) could be the Consumer Price Index or the GDP Deflator. Then, \\(1/P\\) is the value of money measured in units of goods and services. This is also the price of money and the purchasing power of money. So, when the overall price level rises, the value of money falls. 11.3.1 THE CLASSICAL THEORY OF INFLATION: Money Supply, Money Demand, and Monetary Equilibrium It is obvious that the quantity of money determined by the central bank must end up equal to the quantity of money held by the people as currency and checkable bank deposits. But in a free economy, people cannot be forced. Therefore, the quantity of money desired by the central bank must be equal to the quantity of money desired by the people as currency and checkable bank deposits. That is, the money supply must equal the money demand. What economic mechanism makes these two separate things equal? The classical theory of inflation assumes that the price or value of money (\\(1/P\\)) automatically reaches the level at which money supply is equal to money demand. Money supply is a policy variable that is controlled by the central bank. Through instruments such as open-market operations, the central bank controls the quantity of money supplied. In the US, the central bank is called the Fed. Money demand is the quantity of money that people wish to hold as currency and checkable bank deposits. Recall that money has three main functions: medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value. The classical theory assumes that in the long run people wish to hold money because it is a medium of exchange and thereby makes shopping convenient. (The unit of account function doesnt affect people much and there are better stores of value than money that pay higher interest rates.) Although money demand has several determinants, including interest rates earned from the ownership of non-money assets, the most important factor in the long run is the average level of prices in the economy. People hold money because it is the medium of exchange. The amount of money people choose to hold for shopping depends on the prices of goods and services. The higher prices are, the more money the typical transaction requires. Therefore, the higher prices are, the higher the amount of money people will choose to hold in their wallets and in their checking accounts. In the long run, the overall level of prices (\\(P\\)) adjusts to the level at which the demand for money equals the supply. This is monetary equilibrium. 11.3.2 THE CLASSICAL THEORY OF INFLATION: The Effects of Monetary Injection The classical theory of inflation is also called the quantity theory of money. The quantity theory of money says that: The quantity of money available in the economy determines the value of money. As the value of money is \\(1/P\\), when the value of money is determined, so is \\(P\\). The primary cause of inflation is the growth in the quantity of money. Video: Causes of Inflation. Imagine a lot of newly-printed cash is dropped from a helicopter. People could try to spend the extra cash they pick up. They could put the cash in their bank accounts. But even in this case, the banks would lend the money to borrowers and stimulate even more spending. But there isnt any extra stuff to buy because productive capacity has not increased as a result of the money drop. Therefore, the only consequence is that prices will go up. This is the key idea of the Quantity Theory of Money. Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon. Milton Friedman (1912  2006). 11.3.3 THE CLASSICAL THEORY OF INFLATION: The Classical Dichotomy and Monetary Neutrality Nominal variables are variables measured in monetary units. Real variables are variables measured in physical units. According to the classical dichotomy, different forces influence real and nominal variables. According to David Hume and others, real economic variables are not affected by changes in the money supply. Changes in the money supply affect nominal variables but not real variables. This feature of the classical theory of inflation is called monetary neutrality. Monetary neutrality is thought to prevail in the long run. That is why we could study real variables, such as GDP, saving, investment, the real interest rate, the unemployment rate, etc., before we began studying money. 11.3.4 THE CLASSICAL THEORY OF INFLATION: Velocity and the Quantity Equation The classical theory of inflation or the quantity theory of money can also be expressed algebraically as the quantity equation. The velocity of money is the speed at which the typical dollar bill travels around the economy from wallet to wallet in, say, a year. Therefore, the velocity of money, \\(V\\), is the number of times per year that a typical dollar bill is used to buy goods and services. Therefore, \\(V\\) is the dollar value of the goods and services purchased with a dollar bill in a year. Therefore, if the economys quantity of money is \\(M\\) dollars, then the dollar value of the goods and services purchased with \\(M\\) dollars in a year must be \\(M × V\\) dollars. Therefore, \\[M × V = \\textrm{Nominal GDP}.\\] Recall that the overall price level, \\(P\\), can be interpreted as the GDP deflator. That is, \\[P = \\textrm{GDP deflator} = \\textrm{Nominal GDP} /\\textrm{Real GDP}.\\] Therefore, \\[\\textrm{GDP deflator} × \\textrm{Real GDP} = \\textrm{Nominal GDP}.\\] Therefore, \\[P × Y = \\textrm{Nominal GDP}.\\] As both \\(M × V\\) and \\(P × Y\\) are equal to the countrys nominal GDP, they must be equal to each other: \\[\\begin{equation} M × V = P × Y. \\tag{11.1} \\end{equation}\\] Equation (11.1) is the quantity equation. Video: Quantity Theory of Money, Marginal Revolution University, YouTube, January 17, 2017. The quantity equation (\\(M × V = P × Y\\)) implies that the velocity of money can be calculated as the ratio of Nominal GDP to the Quantity of Money: \\[\\begin{equation} V = \\frac{P×Y}{M} = \\frac{\\textrm{Nominal GDP}}{\\textrm{Quantity of Money}}. \\tag{11.2} \\end{equation}\\] Luckily, it is easy to find data on Nominal GDP and the Quantity of Money. So, we can observe the ups and downs of the velocity of money in actual economies. It turns out that the velocity of money is relatively stable over time. Also, as we saw in Chapter 7 (Production and Output), the quantity of money does not affect real GDP. Therefore, \\(M × V = P × Y\\) implies that any change in \\(M\\) causes an proportionate change in \\(P\\). Therefore, rapid inflation is caused by rapid increases in the quantity of money. Video: Causes of Inflation, Marginal Revolution University, YouTube, January 24, 2018 11.3.5 CASE STUDY: Money and Prices during Four Hyperinflations Hyperinflation is inflation that exceeds 50 percent per month. Hyperinflation occurs in some countries because the government prints too much money to pay for its spending. Q: Why do governments print so much money? A: To pay for government spending when neither taxation nor borrowing are vailable options. When the government raises revenue by printing money, it is said to impose an inflation tax. An inflation tax is like a tax on everyone who holds money. The inflation ends when the government institutes fiscal reformssuch as cuts in government spendingthat ends the need to print money. 11.3.5.1 Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe During the 2000s, the Zimbabwe government was unable to cut spending enough or raise tax revenues enough to close its budget deficit. And it could not borrow, as nobody would lend it money. So, it printed money to cover its budget deficit. The result was rampant inflation. Before the hyperinflation in Zimbabwe began, the Zimbabwe dollar was worth a bit more than the US dollar. In January 2008, however, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, the central bank, issued a note worth 10 million Zimbabwe dollars, which was then equivalent to about four (4) US dollars. A year later, a note worth 10 trillion Zimbabwe dollars, equivalent to three (3) US dollars, was issued. The Zimbabwe hyperinflation ended in 2009 when the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe stopped printing Zimbabwe dollars and the nation began using foreign currencies such as the US dollar and the South African rand. Video: Zimbabwe and Hyperinflation. Video: Why Governments Create Inflation. 11.3.6 THE CLASSICAL THEORY OF INFLATION: The Fisher Effect Recall that: \\(\\textrm{Real interest rate} = \\textrm{nominal interest rate}  \\textrm{inflation}\\). Therefore, \\(\\textrm{Real interest rate} + \\textrm{inflation} = \\textrm{nominal interest rate}\\). In this chapter, we have seen that an increase in inflation is caused by an increase in money growth. In an earlier chapter, we saw that an increase in money growth has no effect on the real interest rate, which is determined in the market for loanable funds. Therefore, any change in inflation must be accompanied by an equal change in the nominal interest rate. This is called the Fisher effect, after the economist Irving Fisher. 11.4 The Costs of Inflation These include: Shoeleather costs, menu costs, relative price variability and misallocation of resources inflation-induced tax distortions confusion and inconvenience arbitrary redistribution of wealth 11.4.1 THE COSTS OF INFLATION: A Common Fallacy Inflation does not in itself reduce peoples real purchasing power. Our standard of living depends on GDP, and inflation does not hurt our GDP. Recall from Chapter 7 (Production and Growth) that GDP is determined by other factors: technology, physical and human capital, natural resources, etc. The printing of money causes prices to rise but has no effect on the determinants of real GDP. Recall that monetary neutrality prevails in the long run. However, there are other, more subtle costs of inflation. Costs of Inflation Video: Costs of Inflation: Price Confusion and Money Illusion. Video: Financial Intermediation Failure. 11.4.2 THE COSTS OF INFLATION: Shoeleather Costs Shoeleather costs are the resources wasted when inflation forces people to live with minimal reserves of money. Inflation reduces the purchasing power of money. So people have an incentive to keep their wealth in non-money forms, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, gold, etc. 11.4.3 THE COSTS OF INFLATION: Shoeleather Costs Living with minimal cash reserves requires more frequent trips to a financial institution to convert interest-bearing non-money assets into cash. These extra trips to a financial institution are inconvenient and take time away from productive activities. 11.4.4 THE COSTS OF INFLATION: Menu Costs Menu costs are the costs of adjusting prices Printing new menus Marketing costs of informing customers of the price changes During inflationary times, it is necessary to frequently update price lists and other posted prices. This is a resource-consuming process that takes away from other productive activities. 11.4.5 THE COSTS OF INFLATION: Relative-Price Variability and the Misallocation of Resources Inflation distorts relative prices. This distortion is caused by: Menu costs, and Uncoordinated price changes Decisions of buyers and sellers are distorted, and markets are less able to allocate resources to their best use. 11.4.6 THE COSTS OF INFLATION: Relative-Price Variability and the Misallocation of Resources Changes in the relative price of, say, ice cream to apples are desirable when caused by Demand-related factors (a rise in temperature makes people desire ice cream), and Supply-related factors (a drought that damages the production of apples) Changes in relative prices that are caused by inflation affect the choices of buyers and sellers for no economically useful reasons 11.4.7 THE COSTS OF INFLATION: Inflation-Induced Tax Distortion Inflation exaggerates the size of capital gains and increases the tax burden on this type of income. This reduces the incentive to save for the future, and has a negative long-run effect on the economy. The income tax system treats all of the nominal interest earned on savings as taxable income, even though part of the nominal interest rate merely compensates for inflation. Consequently, when inflation increases the after-tax real interest rate falls, making saving less attractive. 11.4.8 THE COSTS OF INFLATION: Confusion and Inconvenience When the Fed increases the money supply and creates inflation, it reduces the purchasing power of a dollar. Inflation causes the purchasing power of a dollar to be different at different times. Therefore, with rising prices, it is more difficult to compare revenues, costs, and profits over time in inflation-adjusted (or, real) units. 11.4.9 THE COSTS OF INFLATION: A Special Cost of Unexpected Inflation: Arbitrary Redistribution of Wealth When theres unexpected inflation, lenders lose and borrowers gain. When theres unexpected deflation, lenders gain and borrowers lose. These redistributions occur because many loans in the economy are specified in terms of the unit of account: money. Unexpected inflation redistributes wealth among the population in a way that has nothing to do with either merit or need. 11.4.9.1 THE COSTS OF INFLATION: How to protect your savings from inflation We just saw that during unexpected inflation, lenders lose and borrowers gain, and during unexpected deflation, lenders gain and borrowers lose. But inflation-indexed bonds are a way to protect yourself from this. You can lend money to the US government without taking any inflation risk! The U.S. Treasury sells inflation-protected bonds. For these bonds, both interest payments and the principal that is repaid when the bond matures are adjusted for inflation. So, buyers of these bonds are protected from inflation. These bonds are of two types: Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities Series I Savings bonds These bonds can be bought directly from www.treasurydirect.gov. Inflation-indexed bonds are also sold by foreign governments and by private corporations 11.4.10 THE COSTS OF INFLATION: If Inflation is Bad, is Deflation Good? Deflation is negative inflation (or falling prices). The following costs of inflation, are also true for deflation: Menu costs Relative-price variability and the misallocation of resources Confusion and inconvenience Arbitrary redistributions of wealth (unexpected deflation) However, the following costs of inflation are smaller in the case of deflation: Shoeleather costs Inflation-induced tax distortions For this reason, Milton Friedman argued that central banks should aim for mild deflation in the long run Friedman Rule. Recall that \\(\\textrm{nominal interest rate} = \\textrm{real interest rate} + \\textrm{inflation}\\). The Friedman Rule argues that, to keep shoeleather costs low, we should set nominal interest rate = 0. Therefore, \\(\\textrm{real interest rate} + \\textrm{inflation}=0\\). Therefore, \\(\\textrm{inflation}=-\\textrm{real interest rate}\\), which is usually negative. So, according to the Friedman Rule, to set the nominal interest rate at zero, we should aim for mild deflation. The Friedman Rules support of deflation applies in the long run. In the short-run, deflation may be the symptom of a sick economy.

The definition of national saving: \\(S=Y-C-G\\). The quantity theory of money: In the long run, inflation = growth rate of the quantity of money  growth rate of inflation-adjusted GDP The nominal interest rate, the real interest rate, and the difference between them real interest rate = nominal interest rate  inflation real interest rate, ex ante = nominal interest rate  expected inflation 12.2 Definitions Closed and open economies Exports, imports, net exports Trade balance, trade surplus, trade deficit, balanced trade Capital outflow, capital inflow, net capital outflow Exchange rates: nominal and real 12.2.1 Definitions: Closed Economy A closed economy is an economy that has no economic interactions with other economies 12.2.2 Definitions: Open Economy An open economy is an economy whose residents have regular economic interactions with residents of other economies. There are cross-border purchases and sales of goods and services. There are cross-border purchases and sales of financial assets such as stocks and bonds. Some degree of migration may also occur. 12.2.3 Definitions: Exports, Imports, Net Exports Households, businesses, and government entities in open economies trade goods and services with foreigners. Exports = The market value of goods and services that are produced domestically and sold abroad. Imports = The market value of goods and services that are produced abroad and sold domestically. Net exports = Exports  Imports. Net exports is also called the trade balance. 12.2.4 Definitions: trade surplus, trade deficit, balanced trade Net exports could be positive, negative, or zero. A country is said to have: A trade surplus when Net exports &gt; 0. In this case, Exports &gt; Imports. A trade deficit when Net exports &lt; 0. In this case, Exports &lt; Imports. Balanced trade when Net exports = 0. In this case, Exports = Imports. Here are links to US data: Net exports of goods and services Exports of goods and services Imports of goods and services 12.2.5 Definitions: Capital Outflow, Capital Inflow, Net Capital Outflow Households, businesses, and government entities in open economies regularly trade financial and other assets with foreigners. Capital outflow = value of foreign assets purchased by domestic residents. Capital inflow = value of domestic assets purchased by foreign residents. Net capital outflow = capital outflow  capital inflow. Net Capital Outflow: is NCO for short. Also called net foreign investment. Could be positive or negative or zero. 12.3 An Accounting Identity: \\(NX = NCO\\) It turns out that net exports and net capital outflow must always be equal. Why? An individual cant get something for nothing, right? The same is true for countries. A country cant buy more goods, services, and assets from other countries than it sells to other countries. This is the basic reason why \\(NX\\) and \\(NCO\\) must always be equal. For every country, the value of goods and services purchased from other countries + the value of assets purchased from other countries = the value of goods and services sold to other countries + the value of assets sold to other countries. Therefore, rearranging the terms, we see that the value of assets purchased from other countries  the value of assets sold to other countries = the value of goods and services sold to other countries  the value of goods and services purchased from other countries. Therefore, net capital outflow = net exports! In other words, \\(NX = NCO\\). One more time: We just saw that, the value of assets purchased from other countries  the value of assets sold to other countries = the value of goods and services sold to other countries  the value of goods and services purchased from other countries. Recall that: net capital outflow = the value of assets purchased from other countries  the value of assets sold to other countries, and net exports = exports  imports. Therefore, net capital outflow = net exports! 12.4 An Accounting Identity: \\(S = I + NCO\\) I assume that you are aware of the following important macroeconomic ideas: The national income identity: \\(Y = C + I + G + NX\\). The definition of national saving: \\(S = Y - C - G\\). The national income identity says this: A countrys GDP (denoted \\(Y\\)) is the market value of the total output of final goods and services, and is therefore also the total expenditure on final goods and services. This total expenditure must be the sum of consumption spending by households (\\(C\\)), investment spending mainly by businesses (\\(I\\)), government purchases (\\(G\\)), and net exports (\\(NX\\)). The definition of saving says this: GDP, being total expenditureas we just sawis also total income. Income (\\(Y\\)) minus consumption by households (\\(C\\)) and consumption by the government (\\(G\\)) is the natural way to measure national saving (\\(S\\)). Therefore, \\(S = Y - C - G\\). We can rewrite the national income identity as: \\(Y - C - G = I + NX\\). Using the definition of national saving, this becomes: \\(S = I + NX\\). And we have seen above that \\(NX = NCO\\). Therefore, we can write \\(S = I + NCO\\). This makes sense: A nations saving (\\(S\\)) must end up being loaned to domestic borrowers or foreign borrowers. The loans made to domestic borrowers will end up as investment spending mainly by domestic firms (\\(I\\)). And the loans made to foreigners will be net capital outflow (\\(NCO\\)). Therefore, \\(S = I + NCO\\). 12.5 Definition: Exchange Rates, Nominal and Real We discussed exports, imports, and net exports earlier. These are influenced by many factors including international prices. The two most important international prices are: the nominal exchange rate and the real exchange rate. 12.5.1 Definition: Nominal Exchange Rates The nominal exchange rate is the rate at which a person can trade the currency of one country for the currency of another. The nominal exchange rate is expressed in two ways: In units of foreign currency per one U.S. dollar, and In units of U.S. dollars per one unit of the foreign currency. On March 27, 2016 the exchange rate between the Japanese yen (¥) and the U.S. dollar was: $1.00 = ¥113.16 $0.0088 = ¥1.00 12.5.1.1 Definition: Nominal Exchange Rates: Appreciation and Depreciation Appreciation is an increase in the value of a currency (as measured by the amount of foreign currency it can buy). Depreciation is a decrease in the value of a currency. If the price of a dollar increases (say, from ¥100 to ¥120), it is an appreciation of the dollar. If the price of a dollar decreases (say, from ¥100 to ¥80), it is a depreciation of the dollar. 12.5.1.2 Data on Nominal Exchange Rates Trade Weighted U.S. Dollar Index: Broad 12.5.2 Definition: Real Exchange Rates Recall that the nominal exchange rate is the rate at which a person can trade the currency of one country for the currency of another. The real exchange rate is the rate at which a person can trade the goods and services of one country for the goods and services of another. The real exchange rate expresses the prices of domestic goods not in currency units but in units of foreign goods. If a case of German beer is twice as expensive as American beer, the US real exchange rate is 1/2 case of German beer per case of American beer. Note that this expresses the price of a case of American beer in units of German beer. Suppose: Price of U.S. wheat is \\(P\\) = $4.00 per ton Price of French wheat is \\(P^*\\) = 2.00 per ton Price of a dollar is \\(e\\) = 3.00 per dollar Note that: Price of a ton of U.S. wheat is $4.00 or, equivalently, 12.00 (because each dollar is worth 3 euros). Therefore, one ton of U.S. wheat costs the same as six tons of French wheat. Therefore, the real exchange rate = 6. How did we get 6 as the real exchange rate? We multiplied 3 and 4 and divided the result by 2. That is, we calculated \\(e \\times P / P^*\\). Therefore, we see that, in general, \\[\\begin{equation} \\textrm{Real Exchange Rate} = e \\times P / P^*. \\tag{12.1} \\end{equation}\\] The real exchange rate depends on the nominal exchange rate and the prices of goods in the two countries, as measured in local currencies. The real exchange rate is a key determinant of how much a country exports and imports. 12.5.2.1 Data: Real Exchange Rates Real Broad Effective Exchange Rate for United States Real Narrow Effective Exchange Rate for United States 12.6 Theory: Effect of Real Exchange Rates on Net Exports A depreciation (fall) in the U.S. real exchange rate means that U.S. goods have become cheaper relative to foreign goods. This encourages consumers both at home and abroad to buy more U.S. goods and fewer goods from other countries. As a result, U.S. exports rise, and U.S. imports fall. Therefore, U.S. net exports increase. Conversely, an appreciation in the U.S. real exchange rate means that U.S. goods have become more expensive compared to foreign goods. So U.S. net exports fall. 12.6.1 Theory: Purchasing-Power Parity The purchasing-power parity theory is the simplest theory of exchange rates in the long run. According to the purchasing-power parity theory, a unit of any given currency should buy the same quantity of goods in all countries. If a dollar buys 2 grams of gold in China and 5 grams of gold in Canada, one could: buy 5 grams of gold in Canada with a dollar, sell 2 grams of gold in China and get back the dollar that was spent in Canada, and still have 3 grams of gold left over! All this buying in Canada and selling in China will eventually make the price of gold the same in the two countries. The theory of purchasing-power parity is based on a principle called the law of one price. According to the law of one price, a good must sell for the same price in all locations, once the prices are all expressed in the same currency. Consequently, a unit of any given currency should buy the same quantity of goods in all countries. If the law of one price were not true, unexploited profit opportunities would exist. If the same good sold at different prices in different countries, you could make money by simply buying the good where it is cheap and selling it where it is expensive. The process of taking advantage of differences in prices in different markets is called arbitrage. Price of a commodity in USA in $ × ¥ per $ exchange rate = Price of the commodity in USA in ¥. If arbitrage occurs, eventually prices in two markets, expressed in the same currency, must become equal. Therefore: Price of a commodity in USA in $ × ¥ per $ exchange rate = Price of the commodity in Japan in ¥. (Price of a commodity in US in $ × ¥ per $ exchange rate)/(Price of the commodity in Japan in ¥)=1 Or, \\[\\frac{e\\times P^*}{P}=1 \\]. We just saw that under purchasing-power parity, \\(e\\times P^*/P=1\\). But weve seen that \\(e\\times P^*/P\\) is the real exchange rate! So, the purchasing-power parity theory says the real exchange rate must be equal to one. The theory of purchasing-power parity says that the real exchange rate, which is the price of domestic goods in units of foreign goods, must be equal to one, in the long run. The net exports curve becomes horizontal at the long-run real exchange rate. 12.6.2 Implications of Purchasing-Power Parity Weve just seen that in the long run \\(e\\times P^*/P=1\\). This implies \\(e=P/P^*\\). Therefore, when \\(P\\uparrow\\) we have \\(e\\downarrow\\). That is, when prices rise in a country, its currency will be worth less in terms of other currencies. I assume you are aware of the quantity theory of money. It says that in the long run if the quantity of money in an economy increases faster than the output produced, then prices will rise. That is, when the central bank of a country prints large quantities of money, the countrys money loses value in the sense that it buys fewer goods and services. Moreover, as we saw above, the countrys money also loses value in the sense that it buys smaller amounts of other currencies. 12.6.3 Limitations of Purchasing-Power Parity We will discuss another long-run theory of the real exchange rate later. The theory of purchasing-power parity, though intuitive, doesnt fit the real world very well. Many goods are not easily traded or shipped from one country to another. Tradable goods are not always perfect substitutes when they are produced in different countries. See the web site for The Economists Big Mac Currency Index. 12.7 Whats Next? So far, we have seen a simple theory of the real exchange rate. We need a more realistic theory of the real exchange rate. Plus, we need a long-run theory of a countrys net exports.

National saving is always equal to domestic investment plus net capital outflow: \\(S=I+NCO\\). The loanable funds theory of the real interest rate, for closed economies National saving = private-sector saving + government saving Private-sector saving = \\(Y-T-C\\). Government saving = \\(T-G\\). The real exchange rate is the price of domestic products relative to similar foreign products Calculated as \\(e\\times P^*/P\\). Purchasing-power parity theory of the real exchange rate \\(e\\times P^*/P=1\\). 13.2 Loanable Funds Theory of the Real Interest Rate We have seen this accounting identity before: \\(S=I+NCO\\). And we have seen before that this accounting identity makes sense: A nations saving (\\(S\\)) must end up being loaned to domestic borrowers or foreign borrowers. The loans made to domestic borrowers will end up as investment spending mainly by domestic firms (\\(I\\)). And the loans made to foreigners will be net capital outflow (\\(NCO\\)). Therefore, \\(S=I+NCO\\). Now, in a free-market economy, people and/or firms cannot be forced to do this or that. Therefore, desired saving by households must be equal to desired investment spending by firms and households plus desired net capital outflow. How is this accomplished? How are these desired amounts brought into line? The theory of loanable funds says that: Theres a market for loanable funds The supply of loanable funds = desired national saving (\\(S\\)). This supply depends on many factors, including the real interest rate. The supply of loanable funds increases when the real interest rate increases. The demand for loanable funds = desired domestic investment spending (\\(I\\)) + desired net capital outflow (\\(NCO\\)). This demand depends on many factors, including the real interest rate. The demand for loanable funds decreases when the real interest rate increases. The real interest rate reaches an equilibrium level at which supply is equal to demand. In this way, we get \\(S=I+NCO\\) even when the variables are interpreted as the desired amounts. We have seen this accounting identity before: \\(NX = NCO\\). We have seen before that the actual levels of net exports and net capital outflow must be equal: \\(NX = NCO\\). But, in a free-market economy, people and/or firms cannot be forced to do this or that. Therefore, desired net exports must be equal to desired net capital outflow. How is this accomplished? How are these desired amounts brought into line? 13.3 The Market for Foreign-Currency Exchange Just as we may imagine a market in which ice cream is exchanged for currency, or a market in which Amazon shares are exchanged for currency, we may imagine a market in which different currencies are exchanged for each other. Thats the market for foreign-currency exchange. We assume that in this market there is a supply and a demand for every currency. We assume that this markets price reaches the equilibrium level at which supply and demand are equal. The supply of the domestic currency = desired net capital outflow (\\(NCO\\)). This supply depends on many factors, but not on the real exchange rate. Recall that the determination of desired net capital outflow was determined in the market for loanable funds before I even mentioned the real exchange rate. The demand for the domestic currency = desired net exports (\\(NX\\)). This demand depends on many factors, including the real exchange rate. The quantity of the domestic currency demanded decreases when the real exchange rate increases. The real exchange rate reaches an equilibrium level at which supply is equal to demand. In this way, we get \\(NX=NCO\\) even when the variables are interpreted as the desired amounts. 13.4 Simultaneous Equilibrium in Two Markets We need to join together the two markets that weve been discussingthe loanable-funds market and the foreign-currency exchange marketto get to a coherent understanding of long-run open-economy macroeconomics. 13.5 Effects of Policy Changes and Unforeseen Events The point of building a macroeconomic theory of an open economy is to be able to say something that is not totally idiotic about the likely consequences of some policy change or unforeseen event. We will now see what our theory says about the long-run effects of: A tax cut and/or an increase in government spending An import tariff or an import quota Political instability and capital flight 13.5.1 A Tax Cut and/or an Increase in Government Spending Recall that: The supply of loanable funds = national saving (\\(S\\)). National saving = private-sector saving + government saving. Private-sector saving = \\(Y-T-C\\). Government saving = \\(T-G\\). Therefore, a tax cut and/or an increase in government spending implies that \\(T  G\\) decreases. (That is, government saving decreases.) Therefore, national saving (\\(S\\)) decreases. This shifts the supply of loanable funds to the left. 13.5.2 An Import Tariff or an Import Quota An import tariff is a tax on imported goods. An import quota puts a limit on the quantity of imports. Either way, imports will decrease, assuming all other factors that affect imports (such as the real exchange rate) are unchanged. Therefore, net exports (NX = exports  imports) will increase. As a result, the demand for the domestic currency in the market for foreign-currency exchange will shift to the right. As the curves for \\(S\\), \\(I\\), and \\(NCO\\) are unaffected, the market for loanable funds will be unaffected. 13.5.3 Political Instability and Capital Flight An increase in political instability is likely to cause an increase in net capital outflow (also called capital flight, when the outflow is large), assuming all the other factors that affect \\(NCO\\) are unchanged. This will shift the \\(NCO\\) curve to the right. As the two main sources of the demand for loanable funds are investment (\\(I\\)) and net capital outflow (\\(NCO\\)), the demand for loanable funds will shift right. 13.5.4 Summary of Predictions 13.5.5 The Unusual Case of Purchasing-Power Parity "],["ADAS.html", "Chapter 14 Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply 14.1 Introduction 14.2 Recap: The Assumptions of Classical Economics 14.3 Explaining short-run economic fluctuations 14.4 The Model of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply 14.5 The Aggregate-demand curve: Why the Aggregate-Demand Curve Might Shift 14.6 THE AGGREGATE-SUPPLY CURVE 14.7 Two causes of economic fluctuations", " Chapter 14 Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply 14.1 Introduction This chapter focuses on the causes of short-run fluctuations in economic activity. Economic activity fluctuates from year to year. Real GDP increases in most years. On average over the past 50 years, real GDP in the U.S. economy has grown by about 3 percent per year. Real GDP per person has grown at the rate of about 2 percent per year over the past century. In some years normal growth does not occur, causing a recession. A recession is a period of declining real incomes, and rising unemployment. A depression is a severe recession. An expansion is a period of increasing real incomes, and falling unemployment. A boom is a strong expansion Economic fluctuations are irregular and unpredictable. Fluctuations in the economy are often called the business cycle. Most macroeconomic variables fluctuate together. As output falls, unemployment rises. Recessions start at the peak of a business cycle and end at the trough. The length of a business cycle may be measured by the time between one peak and the next or the time between one trough and the next. The peaks and troughs of the US business cycle are officially registered by the NBER. During 1945-2009, there have been 11 cycles in the US. The average recession lasted 11 months and the average expansion lasted 59 months, thereby making the average cycle roughly 70 months long. In the US, there were recessions in 1980 and 1982, just two years apart. On the other hand, there were no recessions between 1991 and 2001. When real GDP falls in a recession, so do many other variables: personal income, corporate profits, consumption spending, investment spending, industrial production, retail sales, home sales, auto sales, etc. However, investment fluctuates a lot more than other variables. Even though investment is about one-seventh of GDP, much of the fall in GDP during recessions is due to the fall in investment spending. The unemployment rate never approaches zero; instead it fluctuates around its natural rate, which itself fluctuates between 5 and 6 percent. 14.2 Recap: The Assumptions of Classical Economics In Chapter 7, we saw that GDP depends on: number of workers physical capital per worker human capital per worker natural resources per worker technological knowledge laws, government policies, and their enforcement In Chapter 8we saw that saving, investment, and the real interest rate depend on the supply and demand for loanable funds. In Chapter 10 we saw that unemployment depends on: how well the labor market matches unemployed workers to job vacancies, and how close the wage is to the equilibrium wage. In Chapter 12, we saw that: the price level depends on the quantity of money, and the rate of inflation depends on the growth rate of the quantity of money, and the factors that affect the real interest rate (Ch. 8) and the inflation rate (Ch. 12) together determine the nominal interest rate. 14.3 Explaining short-run economic fluctuations Most economists believe that the long run theory weve studied in previous chapters does not explain short run fluctuations. In the long run, changes in the money supply affect nominal variables but not real variables. This is monetary neutrality. But most economists believe that monetary neutrality is not true in the short run. Most economists believe that the central banks monetary policy: Has no effect on real variables (especially real GDP and unemployment) in the long run, but Has significant effects on real variables in the short run. Video: Intro to Business Fluctuations, Marginal Revolution University, YouTube, April 11, 2017. 14.4 The Model of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply Economists use the model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply to explain short-run fluctuations in economic activity around its long-run trend. Aggregate demand and aggregate supply are two ways in which real GDP and the overall price level are linked in the short run. The aggregate-demand curve shows the total quantity of Made in USA goods and services that everybodyhouseholds, firms, the government, and foreignerswants to buy at each price level. The aggregate-supply curve shows the total quantity of Made in USA goods and services that US firms would like to produce and sell at each price level. 14.4.1 The Aggregate-demand curve: Why the Aggregate-Demand Curve Slopes Downward The aggregate demand for goods and services has four components: \\[\\begin{equation} \\textrm{Aggregate Demand} = C + I + G + NX. \\tag{14.1} \\end{equation}\\] Here we interpret \\(C\\), \\(I\\), \\(G\\), and \\(NX\\) as the desired levels of consumption, investment, government purchases, and net exports. 14.4.1.1 Why the demand curve for ice cream cant explain the AD curve The demand curve for an individual commodity is downward sloping because of two effects: Substitution effect: when ice cream becomes cheaper people buy more ice cream because they are switching from frozen yogurt (a substitute) Income effect: when price of ice cream falls and income is unchanged, people feel richer and, therefore, buy more ice cream But the AD curve can consider only changes in the overall price level. If all prices decrease, there can be no substitution effect. It is inconsistent to talk about changes in aggregate demand while assuming unchanged income, because aggregate income must be equal to aggregate demand. Therefore, the income effect cant be applied to the aggregate economy. The Aggregate-Demand Curve Slopes Downward because of: The Wealth Effect: a lower price level boosts consumption spending by households (\\(C\\)) The Interest-Rate Effect: a lower price level boosts investment spending by businesses (\\(I\\)) The Exchange-Rate Effect: a lower price level boosts net exports (\\(NX\\)) As a result, a lower price level boosts aggregate demand (\\(C + I + G + NX\\)). 14.4.1.2 The Aggregate-demand curve: Why the Aggregate-Demand Curve Slopes Downward: The Price Level and Consumption: The Wealth Effect If all prices fall (\\(P\\downarrow\\)), the purchasing power of consumers monetary wealth increases. This causes consumption spending to rise (\\(C\\uparrow\\)) Besides, if the price decline is perceived to be temporary it makes sense to buy what you need now, while prices are still low. The rise in consumption spending (\\(C\\uparrow\\)) raises aggregate demand (\\(C + I + G + NX\\uparrow\\)). Wealth Effect Controversy: Could the aggregate demand curve be upward sloping? \\(P\\downarrow\\) causes the real burden of the monetary debts of debtors to increase. This causes debtors consumption to fall. Therefore, if the decrease in debtors consumption exceeds the increase in the consumption of others, it is possible that consumption spending may fall \\(C\\downarrow\\). Therefore, \\(P\\downarrow\\) could cause aggregate demand to fall (\\(C+I+G+NX\\downarrow\\)). For this reason, the economist Paul Krugman has argued that the AD curve may in some cases be upward rising! 14.4.1.3 The Aggregate-demand curve: Why the Aggregate-Demand Curve Slopes Downward: The Price Level and Investment: The Interest-Rate Effect When all prices fall, people need less cash for shopping needs. They lend the unneeded cash. The increased availability of loans reduces the interest rate. (See Ch. 16 for more on this. ) A lower interest rate encourages greater investment spending by businesses (\\(I\\uparrow\\)). This rise in investment spending raises aggregate demand (\\(C + I + G + NX\\uparrow\\)). 14.4.1.4 The Aggregate-demand curve: Why the Aggregate-Demand Curve Slopes Downward: The Price Level and Net Exports: The Exchange-Rate Effect We saw above that lower prices lead to a lower interest rate. (See Ch. 16 for more on this.) Disappointed foreigners sell the dollars they had been holding in US banks. The value of the dollar falls. As a result, US goods become cheaper relative to foreign goods. This makes U.S. net exports increase (\\(NX\\uparrow\\)). \\(NX\\uparrow\\) means aggregate demand rise (\\(C+I+G+NX\\uparrow\\)). 14.5 The Aggregate-demand curve: Why the Aggregate-Demand Curve Might Shift Shifts of the aggregate demand curve could arise from changes in: Consumption: consumer optimism, tax rates, prices of assets (stocks, bonds, real estate) Investment: technological progress, business confidence, tax rates, money supply Government Purchases Net Exports: foreign GDP, expectations about exchange rates Video: The Aggregate Demand Curve, Marginal Revolution University, YouTube, April 18, 2017. In this video, the growth rate of real GDP is measured on the horizontal axis and the growth rate of the price level (that is, inflation) is measured on the vertical axis. 14.6 THE AGGREGATE-SUPPLY CURVE The upward-sloping aggregate supply curve that we saw before is more precisely called the short-run aggregate-supply (SRAS) curve. The long-run aggregate-supply (LRAS) curve is vertical. 14.6.1 The Aggregate-Supply curve: Why the Aggregate-Supply Curve Is Vertical in the Long Run An economys long-run output of goods and services is also called the natural rate of output or potential output or full-employment output. (See Chapter 7.) Long-run output depends on: labor physical capital human capital natural resources Technology Laws, government policies, and their enforcement The price level does not affect these variables in the long run. 14.6.1.1 The Aggregate-SUPPLY curve: Why the Long-Run Aggregate-Supply Curve Might Shift Any change in the economy that alters the natural rate of output will shift the long-run aggregate-supply curve. So, the long-run aggregate supply will shift because of changes in: Labor: population growth, immigration, natural rate of unemployment Capital, physical or human Natural Resources: price of imported oil Technology Laws, government policies Video: The Long-Run Aggregate Supply Curve, Marginal Revolution University, YouTube, April 25, 2017. This LRAS has the growth rate of real GDP on the horizontal axis and the growth rate of the price level (inflation) on the vertical axis. 14.6.2 The Aggregate-Supply curve: Why the Aggregate-Supply Curve Slopes Upward in the Short Run In the short run, an increase in the overall level of prices tends to raise the quantity of goods and services supplied. A decrease in the level of prices tends to reduce the quantity of goods and services supplied. Why? Why the Aggregate-Supply Curve Slopes Upward in the Short Run: The Sticky-Wage Theory The Sticky-Price Theory The Misperceptions Theory These are three different arguments, but they all reach the same conclusion: \\[\\begin{equation} Y = Y_N+a\\times(P-P^e). \\tag{14.2} \\end{equation}\\] Note: If \\(P = P^e\\), then \\(Y = Y_N\\). 14.6.3 The Aggregate-Supply curve: Why the Short-Run Aggregate-Supply Curve Might Shift The SRAS curve shifts right if: The expected price falls, or The natural rate of output increases 14.6.3.1 The Aggregate-SUPPLY curve: Why the Aggregate-Supply Curve Slopes Upward in the Short Run: The Sticky-Wage Theory Suppose wages for 2019 were agreed upon in 2018. These 2018 wage agreements were based on the output prices that were expected to prevail in 2019. Suppose, in 2019, actual prices turn out less than what had been expected (back in 2018). Wages cannot adjust immediately to the unexpectedly low price level (because they were settled in 2018). An unexpectedly low price level and an unchanged wage level makes employment and production less profitable. This induces firms to reduce the quantity of goods and services supplied; workers lose jobs. In other words, the short-run AS curve is upward rising. Video: Sticky Wages, Marginal Revolution University, YouTube, May 2, 2017 14.6.3.2 The Aggregate-SUPPLY curve: Why the Aggregate-Supply Curve Slopes Upward in the Short Run: The Sticky-Price Theory As a result of menu costs (see Ch. 12), some firms may be unable to change their prices in response to changing economic conditions. An unexpected fall in the overall price level leaves such firms with high prices relative to other firms that can quickly adjust their prices. This depresses their sales, which induces these firms to reduce the quantity of goods and services they produce. Workers lose jobs. 14.6.3.3 The Aggregate-Supply curve: Why the Aggregate-Supply Curve Slopes Upward in the Short Run: The Misperceptions Theory Suppose an overall decline in demand reduces all prices A wheat farmer sees only that wheat prices have fallen and continues to believe that the prices of the things that she buys (milk, shoes, clothes, etc.) are unchanged at the level she had expected This makes work less attractive and so the farmer reduces her production of wheat. I am assuming that the wheat farmer knows only how to produce wheat When this is repeated across the economy, both the overall price level and total output fall. So, production decreases below the full-employment level when \\(P\\) falls below \\(P^e\\). In other words, the AS curve is upward rising. Video: The Short-Run Aggregate Supply Curve, Marginal Revolution University, YouTube, May 9, 2017. In this treatment, the SRAS has the growth rate of real GDP on the horizontal axis and the growth rate of the price level (inflation) on the vertical axis. 14.7 Two causes of economic fluctuations Focus on (a) long-run equilibrium, (b) short-run equilibrium following a disturbance that throws the economy off the long-run equilibrium, and (c) the readjustment to a new long-run equilibrium after the disturbance 14.7.1 Two causes of economic fluctuations: The Effects of a Shift in Aggregate Demand When there is a contraction (leftward shift) in Aggregate Demand, these are the short run effects: output decreases, the overall price level decreases, and the unemployment rate increases And these are the long run effects: the overall price level decreases, but output and the unemployment rate remain unchanged at their long-run levels. So, the economy heals itself in the long run. But it is unclear how long this self-healing might take. If production and employment take too long to return to their long-run levels, the government could step in to hasten the process of healing. The government could push the aggregate demand curve back where it was. It could do so by: increasing the money supply (expansionary monetary policy) cutting taxes or increasing government spending (expansionary fiscal policy) 14.7.1.1 History of Economic Fluctuations Caused by Changes in Aggregate Demand In history, there have been two big shifts in aggregate demand: Great Depression World War II The Great Depression of the early 1930s was by far the worst economic downturn in US history. From 1929 to 1933: Real GDP fell by 27% Unemployment rose from 3 to 25% Price level fell by 22% Most historians blame a decrease in aggregate demand. Specifically, most historians blame the 28% fall in the money supply. People lost faith in the banking system and began to withdraw their money. Banks did not have the money to lend to businesses. Starved of loans, businesses shut down. Other businesses had to abandon expansion plans. The Fed could have printed money and loaned it to the banks, but that did not happen. Another suggested cause of the fall in aggregate demand during the Great Depression was the Stock market crash. It led to a decrease in household wealth which led to a decrease in consumption spending which led to a decrease in aggregate demand. In the case of World War II, the early 1940s saw a large increase in real GDP. More resources were made available to the military. Government purchases increased fivefold 1939 - 1944. Aggregate demand  increased 1939 - 1944. This led to: Doubling of the economys production of goods and services. 20% increase in the price level Unemployment fell from 17% to 1%, lowest in US history In the case of the Great Recession of 2008-09, the crisis of 2008 may have been caused by the Feds overreaction to the recession of 2001. The Fed cut interest rates sharply at that time and kept them low for too long. Those low interest rates may have fueled a bubble in home prices. Ther were significant developments in the mortgage market. It became easier for subprime borrowers to get loans. Borrowers with a higher risk of default (as indicated by income and credit history) received generous loans. Securitization became prominent. It is a process by which a financial institution (mortgage originator) makes loan, and then another (investment bank) bundles them together into mortgage-backed securities. The mortgage-backed securities were sold to other institutions, which may not have fully appreciated the risks in these securities. Inadequate regulation of these high-risk loans, and misguided government policy encouraged this high-risk lending. During 1995-2006: Increase in housing demand Increase in housing prices, which more than doubled During 2006-2009: housing prices fell 30% Substantial rise in mortgage defaults and home foreclosures Financial institutions that owned mortgage-backed securities suffered huge losses and stopped making loans All this led to a large contractionary shift in the AD curve. Real GDP fell sharply: By 4.2% between the forth quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 2009 Employment fell sharply: Unemployment rate rose from 4.4% in May 2007 to 10.0% in October 2009 Three policy actions were taken - aimed in part at returning AD to its previous level: The Fed reacted as follows: Cut its target for the federal funds rate from 5.25% in September 2007 to about zero in December 2008 Started buying mortgage-backed securities and other private loans in open-market operations Provided banks with additional funds The U.S. Treasury reacted as follows: In October 2008, Wall Street bailout $700 billion was put in place. This was for the Treasury to use: to rescue the financial system To stem the financial crisis on Wall Street To make loans easier to obtain The equity injections into banks meant that the U.S. government temporarily became a part owner of these banks. In January 2009, President Barack Obama assumed office. He signed the $787 billion stimulus bill, on February 17, 2009, to be spent over two years. Recovery officially began June 2009. But it was slow: average annual growth was 2.1% during 2009Q2  2015Q4. Unemployment fell to 5.0% by end of 2015, but employment-population ratio was unchanged. Video: The Great Recession, Marginal Revolution University, YouTube, August 9, 2016 14.7.2 Two causes of economic fluctuations: The Effects of a Shift in Aggregate Supply A leftward shift in Short-Run Aggregate Supply has the following effects: Output falls below the natural rate of output Unemployment rises The price level rises If the government does nothing, the SRAS gradually shifts back to where it was. The price level, total production and unemployment is unaffected in the long run. Leftward shifts in aggregate supply cause stagflationa period of recession and inflation. Output falls and prices rise. Policymakers can influence aggregate demand. But they cannot offset both of these adverse effects simultaneously. Policymakers may respond to a recession in one of the following ways: Do nothing and wait for prices and wages to adjust. Take action to increase aggregate demand by using (expansionary) monetary and fiscal policy. 14.7.2.1 John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Our understanding of the short-run behavior of the economy grew out of economists attempts to understand why the Great Depression happened. Published in 1936, Keyness The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money laid the foundations. The long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we are all dead. Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us when the storm is long past, the ocean will be flat. From A Tract on Monetary Reform by John Maynard Keynes (1923) Video: Game of Theories: The Keynesians, Marginal Revolution University, YouTube, November 7, 2017 Video: Game of Theories: The Great Recession, Marginal Revolution University, YouTube, December 5, 2017 "],["ADpolicy.html", "Chapter 15 The Influence of Monetary and Fiscal Policy on Aggregate Demand 15.1 Introduction 15.2 Aggregate demand and the interest-rate effect 15.3 The Theory of Liquidity Preference 15.4 The Downward Slope of the Aggregate Demand Curve 15.5 Monetary Policy, expansionary and contractionary 15.6 HOW FISCAL POLICY INFLUENCES AGGREGATE DEMAND 15.7 Stabilization policy: for and against", " Chapter 15 The Influence of Monetary and Fiscal Policy on Aggregate Demand 15.1 Introduction Monetary policy refers to the control of a countrys quantity of money by its central bank. We saw the long-run effects of monetary policy in Chapter 12 (Money Growth and Inflation). Fiscal policy refers to the governments decisions about the governments purchases and taxation. We saw the long-run effects of fiscal policy in Chapter 8 (Saving, Investment, and the Financial System). Now we will look at the short-run effects of monetary policy and fiscal policy. In previous chapters, we have seen that the AD curve shifts rightward when we have an increase in the demand for: Consumption, which could happen because of: an increase in consumer optimism tax cuts increases in prices of assets (stocks, bonds, real estate) Investment, which could happen because of: technological progress an increase in business confidence business tax cuts an increase in the money supply leading to lower interest rates Government purchases Net Exports, which could happen because of: increases in foreign GDP the expectation of an increase in the value of a foreign currency leading to an immediate increase in the value of the foreign currency When the AD curve shifts, it causes short-run fluctuations in output and employment. Monetary and fiscal policy are sometimes used to offset those shifts and stabilize the economy. This chapter takes a closer look at how monetary policy and fiscal policy shift the Aggregate Demand curve. 15.2 Aggregate demand and the interest-rate effect In previous chapters, we have seen that there are three effects that help us think about Aggregate Demand. Specifically, the aggregate demand curve slopes downward for three reasons: The wealth effect The interest-rate effect The exchange-rate effect See the previous chapter for further details. 15.3 The Theory of Liquidity Preference John Maynard Keynes developed the theory of liquidity preference to explain the behavior of the interest rate in the short run. According to this theory, the interest rate adjusts to balance the supply and demand for money. (Warning: The theory of interest rates in Chapter 8 no longer applies. That was the long run; now its the short run.) Recall that in previous chapters we have seen two kinds of interest rates: nominal and real. The nominal interest rate is what people commonly understand as the interest rate. It is not adjusted for inflation. It measures how fast the money in your bank account grows over time. The real interest rate = nominal interest rate  expected inflation. It is adjusted for inflation. It measures how fast the purchasing power of the money in your bank account is expected to grow. In an earlier chapter, I had said that the real interest rate = nominal interest rate  inflation. Now I am saying that the real interest rate = nominal interest rate  expected inflation. Q: Why is the definition different in the short run? A: In long-run analysis it is assumed that expected inflation = actual inflation. The theory of liquidity preference is a short-run theory of the nominal interest rate. However, short-run analysis assumes that the expected inflation is exogenous. Therefore, any change in the nominal interest rate causes an identical change in the real interest rate. So, the theory of liquidity preference can also be seen as a theory of the real interest rate. Consequently, from now on in this chapter, I will not distinguish between nominal and real interest rates. 15.3.1 The Theory of Liquidity Preference: Money Supply The money supply is controlled by the Fed through: Open-market operations Changes in the reserve requirements Changes in the discount rate Because it is fixed by the Fed, the quantity of money supplied does not depend on the interest rate. The money supply is consequently represented by a vertical supply curve. 15.3.2 The Theory of Liquidity Preference: Money Demand Money demand is determined by three main factors: 15.3.2.1 interest rate money demand  People choose to hold money instead of other assets that offer higher rates of return because money can be used to buy goods and services. The opportunity cost of holding money is the interest that could be earned on interest-earning assets. An increase in the interest rate raises the opportunity cost of holding money. As a result, the quantity of money demanded decreases. 15.3.2.2 overall price level money demand When prices rise people need to keep more cash at hand for transactions purposes. 15.3.2.3 real GDP money demand An increase in real GDP represents an increase in real output, real income, and real expenditure. When people spend more they naturally need to keep more cash at hand for transactions purposes. 15.3.2.4 Overall: P, Y, r  Money Demand 15.3.3 The Theory of Liquidity Preference: Equilibrium in the Money Market According to the theory of liquidity preference: The interest rate adjusts to balance the supply and demand for money. There is one interest rate, called the equilibrium interest rate, at which the quantity of money demanded equals the quantity of money supplied. Assume the following about the economy: For any given price level, the interest rate adjusts to balance the supply and demand for money. The interest rate determines aggregate demand along with the other factors we saw in the previous chapter. So, Price Level influences the Interest Rate which in turn influences Aggregate Demand. This gives us the AD curve. The level of output is determined by the equality of aggregate demand and aggregate supply. 15.3.4 The Downward Slope of the Aggregate Demand Curve: interest rate effect overall price level (P) money demand Higher money demand leads to a higher interest rate. At a higher interest rate the quantity of goods and services demanded falls. interest rate investment spending by businesses (I) even consumption spending (C) may  Therefore, P C + I + G + NX 15.4 The Downward Slope of the Aggregate Demand Curve The end result of this analysis is a negative relationship between the price level and the quantity of goods and services demanded. 15.5 Monetary Policy, expansionary and contractionary 15.5.1 Changes in the Money Supply The Fed can shift the aggregate demand curve when it changes its monetary policy. 15.5.1.1 Expansionary Monetary Policy When the Fed increases the money supply, it lowers the interest rate and increases the quantity of goods and services demanded at any given price level, shifting aggregate-demand to the right. An increase in the money supply shifts the money supply curve to the right. The interest rate falls. Falling interest rates increase the quantity of goods and services demanded. 15.5.1.2 Contractionary Monetary Policy When the Fed reduces the money supply, it raises the interest rate and reduces the quantity of goods and services demanded at any given price level, shifting aggregate-demand to the left. 15.5.2 The Role of Interest-Rate Targets in Fed Policy Monetary policy can be described either in terms of the money supply or in terms of the interest rate. Changes in monetary policy can be viewed either in terms of a changing target for the interest rate or in terms of a change in the money supply. A target for the federal funds rate affects the money market equilibrium, which influences aggregate demand. 15.5.3 Expansionary Monetary Policy: Criticisms 15.5.3.1 Crisis of 2008: monetary stimulus The Federal Reserve did all it could. But the Federal Funds Rate could not be reduced below zero! Critics of expansionary monetary policy have also argued that even if an increase in the money supply succeeds in reducing the interest rate, the fall in the interest rate may not lead to an increase in investment spending by businesses (I). Why? Business investment spending is heavily influenced by optimism or pessimism; interest rates play a minor role. 15.6 HOW FISCAL POLICY INFLUENCES AGGREGATE DEMAND Fiscal policy refers to the governments choices regarding government purchases (G) and taxes (T). As we saw in an earlier chapter, fiscal policy influences saving, investment, and growth in the long run. In the short run, however, fiscal policy primarily affects the aggregate demand. 15.6.1 Fiscal policy: expansionary and contractionary 15.6.1.1 Expansionary fiscal policy: G or T This is also called a fiscal stimulus or a budgetary stimulus. It decreases government saving T  G. 15.6.1.2 Contractionary fiscal policy: G or T This is also called fiscal austerity or belt tightening. It increases government saving T  G. 15.6.2 Changes in Government Purchases When policymakers change the money supply or taxes, the effect on aggregate demand is indirectthrough the spending decisions of firms or households. When the government alters its own purchases of goods or services (G), it shifts the aggregate-demand curve directly. There are two important macroeconomic consequences of a change in government purchases: The multiplier effect The crowding-out effect 15.6.2.1 The Multiplier Effect Government purchases are said to have a multiplier effect on aggregate demand. Each dollar spent by the government may raise the aggregate demand for goods and services by more than a dollar. Government spending increases income and thereby increases consumer spending which leads to further increases in income. G aggregate demandYC aggregate demand   Y  CYCYCYC 15.6.2.2 A Formula for the Spending Multiplier The formula for the spending multiplier is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\textrm{Government Spending Multiplier}\\equiv\\frac{1}{1-\\textrm{MPC}} \\tag{15.1} \\end{equation}\\] An important number in this formula is the marginal propensity to consume (MPC). The MPC is the fraction of every additional dollar of income that a household spends on domestic goods and services. The bigger the MPC, the bigger the spending multiplier. If the MPC is 3/4, then the multiplier will be: Multiplier = 1/(1 - 3/4) = 4. In this case, a $20 billion increase in government spending generates $80 billion of increased demand for goods and services. If the MPC is 9/10, then the multiplier will be: Multiplier = 1/(1 - 9/10) = 10. In this case, a $20 billion increase in government spending generates $200 billion of increased demand for goods and services. 15.6.2.3 The Size of the Spending Multiplier The continuous chain effect described by the multiplier effect works only if there is enough unemployed labor available. The multiplier effect will end up creating jobs in other countries if people end up spending their incomes on imported goods. 15.6.3 The Crowding-Out Effect Government spending may not affect the economy as strongly as predicted by the government spending multiplier. An increase in government purchases causes GDP to increase (as indicated by the multiplier effect) This increases the demand for money. The liquidity preference theory argues that people wish to carry more money when incomes increase because of increased shopping. This causes the interest rate to rise. A higher interest rate reduces investment spending and, therefore, aggregate demand. This reduction in demand that results when a fiscal expansion raises the interest rate is called the crowding-out effect. The crowding-out effect tends to dampen the effects of fiscal policy on aggregate demand. When the government increases its purchases by $20 billion, the aggregate demand for goods and services could rise by more or less than $20 billion, depending on whether the multiplier effect or the crowding-out effect is larger. 15.6.4 Changes in Taxes When the government cuts personal income taxes, it increases households take-home pay. Households save some of this additional income. Households also spend some of the tax cut on consumer goods. Increased consumption spending shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the right. The size of a tax cuts impact on aggregate demand depends on: the multiplier effect the crowding-out effect whether the tax cut is perceived to be temporary or permanent 15.6.4.1 Tax cuts: temporary v. permanent The effect of a tax cut on aggregate demand is also affected by households perceptions about the permanence of the tax change. If the tax cut is perceived to be temporary, most of the tax cut will be saved rather than spent. Therefore, a temporary tax cut will not boost aggregate demand much. 15.7 Stabilization policy: for and against The efforts of the government to increase aggregate demand during a recession are called stabilization policy. Economic stabilization has been an explicit goal of U.S. policy since the Employment Act of 1946. This act states that it is the continuing policy and responsibility of the federal government to  promote full employment and production. 15.7.1 The Case for Active Stabilization Policy The Employment Act has two implications: The government should avoid being the cause of economic fluctuations. The government should respond to changes in the private economy in order to stabilize aggregate demand. If private-sector activity pushes aggregate demand to the left (thereby causing a recession), the government should do what it can to push aggregate demand to the right (thereby ending the recession) 15.7.2 What is the evidence that stabilization policy works? The large increases in public spending in the US after WW II are widely regarded as having played a crucial role in rescuing the economy from the Great Depression. Key point: if the private sector refuses to spend, the government may have to be the spender of last resort. Similarly, the large tax cuts during the (short-lived) Kennedy administration are also widely regarded as having led to rapid growth. 15.7.3 The Case Against Active Stabilization Policy Some economists argue that monetary and fiscal policy destabilizes the economy. Why? Because monetary and fiscal policy affect the economy with a substantial lag. These lagged (or mistimed) effects destabilize the economy instead of stabilizing it. Therefore, opponents of stabilization policy say that the economy should be left to deal with the short-run fluctuations on its own. 15.7.3.1 How lags reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy Most economists believe that it takes at least six months for monetary policy to affect output and employment. And these effects can then last for several years. Economic forecasting is very imprecise. It is difficult to implement monetary policy six months before a recession. When monetary policy reacts late, the AD curve may shift right after the economy has already recovered. This would destabilize the economy. 15.7.3.2 How lags reduce the effectiveness of fiscal policy The lags that reduce the effectiveness of fiscal policy are largely due to the sluggishness of the political process. 15.7.4 Crisis of 2008: fiscal stimulus The US government tried a $800 billion fiscal stimulus consisting of tax cuts and spending. According to the Congressional Budget Office, it worked. But the stimulus was too small. There was insurmountable political opposition to any fiscal stimulus from the Republican Party. They pointed to the large government debt that had accumulated. 15.7.5 Budget deficits and the national debt Recall that expansionary fiscal policy leads to an increase in government borrowing (budget deficit). If a government keeps borrowing year after year, its debt accumulates. As the governments debt accumulates, lenders may start to worry about the possibility of default  As a result, the interest rate the government has to pay may rise. This rise in the interest rate may further increase the probability of default. As a result, the interest rate the government has to pay may rise again. This rise in the interest rate may increase the probability of default yet again. And so on and on  At some point, the first flickers of suspicion among lenders may turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy, and default may become inevitable. This is especially the case when the interest rate the government has to pay exceeds the rate of growth of the economys income. A country with low government debt has a lot of room to use fiscal stimulus to fight a recession. 15.7.5.1 The Balanced Budget Multiplier In theory, it is possible to use expansionary fiscal policy without any additional borrowing by the government! Suppose both government spending and taxes rise by $800 billion. No additional borrowing would be necessary And yet, aggregate demand would increase. (Why?) If $800 billion fell from the sky, people would spend part of it (say, $700 billion) and save the rest ($100 billion). By reverse reasoning, if the government took away $800 billion in taxes, spending by taxpayers would fall by $700 billion. But, the governments spending would rise by $800 billion. Therefore, on balance, total spending would rise by $100 billion. In this way, the balanced-budget expansion of both government spending and taxes increases the aggregate demand for domestic goods and services without any increase in government borrowing! Unfortunately, I know of no examples of this trick actually being implemented. 15.7.5.2 Automatic Stabilizers Automatic stabilizers are changes in fiscal policy that stimulate aggregate demand when the economy goes into a recession without policymakers having to do anything. Examples of automatic stabilizers include: a progressive tax system unemployment insurance means-tested forms of government spending. When incomes decrease, so do the governments tax revenues. This automatic tax cut boosts aggregate demand just when such a boost is most needed. Government spending on unemployment insurance, welfare benefits, and other forms of income support also act as automatic stabilizers. Unfortunately, these automatic stabilizers are not always sufficiently strong and, therefore, policy makers may still need to enact stabilization policies. 15.7.5.3 Balanced Budget Amendment Some politicians, upset by our huge budget deficits, support a balanced budget amendment to the US constitution. A balanced budget constitutional amendment would force the government to always keep tax revenue equal to government spending (G = T, always). Such an amendment would end the role of automatic stabilizers in our current system. We have seen before that during a recession, incomes decrease and the governments tax revenues also decrease. Under a balanced budget amendment, the fall in tax revenues would force the government to cut government spending. A reduction in government spending during a recession would be highly inappropriate. For this reason, many economists are opposed to a balanced budget amendment. However, keeping the budget balanced in the long run may be a good idea. "]]
